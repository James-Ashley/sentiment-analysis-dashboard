# News Headlines on Immigration
Version 1.0.0

## Description
The purpose of this project was to display data on newspaper headlines related to immigration on an interactive website.

## Background
This project builds on our prior projects ([Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/James-Ashley/sentiment_analysis), [Article Web Scraping](https://github.com/James-Ashley/News_Full_Text_Articles)) and examines the sentiment of newspaper headlines and bigrams of both newspaper headlines and full length articles. 

Newspapers are notoriously biased which would suggest that the language of news articles is not neutral. News sources are also criticized for always focusing on sensational or negative topics rather than providing more balanced reporting. We were interested in exploring this by analyzing frequent bigrams and the sentiment of news covering a politically charged topic in the US: immigration.

## Data
We collected the articles using NewsAPI's keyword search. We searched for the terms immigration, immigrant(s), refugee(s), and migrant(s). NewsAPI does not return the full text of the articles, so we then webscraped the full text using Newspapers3k. Duplicate articles and articles with missing urls/headlines/text were removed. In addition, any news source with fewer than 50 articles was removed from the dataset. 

After cleaning, the dataset included 3094 articles published from September 2020 - December 2020. 9 news sources were included:
* Al Jazeera
* Breitbart News
* CBS News
* CNN
* Fox News
* NBC News 
* The Washington Post
* USA Today

## Methods
### Data Analysis
The sentiment scores of the headlines were determined using NLTK Vader. We classified sentiment categories based on the compound scores generated by NLTK Vader: negative < -0.2, positive > 0.2, and -0.2 <= neutral <= 0.2.

Bigrams of the headlines and the full length articles were determined using NLTK's bigrams analysis. Bigrams containing non-word text and function words were excluded from this analysis. Bigrams were then sorted by raw frequency (full length text) or PMI (headlines) and the top bigrams were selected. 

### App Architecture
![alt text](https://github.com/James-Ashley/sentiment-analysis-dashboard/blob/main/static/images/architecture.jpg "App Architecture")

In this full stack application, data is stored in MongoDB and then pulled, filtered and analyzed in a Flask API. There were 5 types of API routes used in this app.
1. News Sources: This route returns a list of all news sources in the database.
2. Sentiment Scores: This route returns the raw data and can be filtered by news source.
3. Sentiment Counts: This route returns the total number of occurrences of each sentiment category. This route can be filtered by news source.
4. Keywords: This route pulls the headlines from the database and then determines and returns the top 50 most frequent words using NLTK. This route can be filtered by news source.
5. Bigrams: This route returns the headline or full text bigrams.

We conducted API calls in JS and then created visualizations using D3.js, D3-cloud.js and Plotly.js.

## Limitations
Although NLTK Vader performs well on different text types (Gilbert & Hutto, 2014), it was initially designed to evaluate the sentiment of social media, and we only loosely verified its accuracy in our sentiment analysis. Future research should include creating a training dataset of news headlines related to immigration to train a new sentiment classifier and/or improve Vader's performance.

In addition, as can be seen in the keyword and bigram analyses, the news cycle is heavily influenced by current events, and we could only access the last few months of news. Continuing to collect news articles over time will allow us to better evaluate which words are related to immigration vs. words that are frequently occuring due to specific events.
