London (CNN) The pandemic has put 500,000 more girls at risk of being forced into child marriage this year, reversing 25 years of progress that saw child marriage rates decline, according to a new report by the charity Save the Children.  Before the global outbreak, 12 million girls married each year, now the charity warns that up to 2.5 million more girls could be at risk of child marriage over the next five years.  With up to 117 million children estimated to fall into poverty in 2020, many will face pressure to work and help provide for their families.  "The pandemic means more families are being pushed into poverty, forcing many girls to work to support their families, to go without food, to become the main caregivers for sick family members, and to drop out of school -- with far less of a chance than boys of ever returning," Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children International, said in a press release  The pandemic led to school closures and "experience during the Ebola outbreak suggests many girls will never return" to class due "to increasing pressure to work, risk of child marriage, bans on pregnant girls attending school, and lost contact with education," the charity wrote.
