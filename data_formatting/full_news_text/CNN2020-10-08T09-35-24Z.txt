(CNN) Three men stormed a factory in Tripoli, doused a Nigerian worker in petrol, and set him on fire, according to a statement by the Libyan interior ministry, in a new reported attack on migrants in the north African country.  The United Nations has described the man's death "another senseless crime against migrants in the country."  A statement by Tripoli's interior ministry on Wednesday said the suspects -- all Libyan nationals -- had been detained for the attack on the man, who has not been named.  The ministry cited witness testimony that described the men storming the factory and setting the Nigerian man on fire.  "We are horrified by the killing of a Nigerian migrant worker in Tripoli, #Libya by three men yesterday. The young man was burned alive, in yet again another senseless crime against migrants in the country," tweeted Federico Soda , head of the UN's International Organization of Migration mission in Libya. "Those responsible must be held to account."  NGO Sea Watch 3 rescued 47 migrants onboard a rubber boat off Libya's coast on January 19, 2019.  Read More Nigerian migrant worker burned alive in Libya
