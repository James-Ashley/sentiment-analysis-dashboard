Mark Zandi is chief economist of Moody's Analytics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.  The election has yet to be decided and we may not know who won for days or even weeks. But, as of this writing, it seems investors are pricing in a Joe Biden presidency and a split Congress, where Republicans continue to control the Senate and Democrats the House.  Stock prices are up big on the election news, and long-term interest rates are down big. The reaction in financial markets to the election is telling us a lot about what investors think it all means for the economy.  Most immediately, investors appear to be betting that the election results will be settled in the next few days at most and that worries about vote counts being seriously contested and ultimately dragged all the way to the Supreme Court weeks from now are misplaced. The race is close, but not close enough to credibly argue that cheating changed the outcome.  Stock investors also appear cheered by the prospects for a split government that will make big changes to economic policy more difficult. Getting any major legislation into law won't be easy. Remember President Obama's second term? It seemed as if he was constantly doing political battle with a Republican Senate. As a result, not much economic policy of consequence got done.  That's good news to shareholders who are wary of Biden's proposal to increase taxes on corporations, which would mean businesses will have less cash to pay dividends and make share repurchases. Investors may also be doing some handwringing over Biden's desire to increase the federal minimum wage , another campaign proposal that likely won't happen if he comes into office with a Republican-led Senate. A divided Congress would be a great thing for investors
