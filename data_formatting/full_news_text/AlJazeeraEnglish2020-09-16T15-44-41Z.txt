[Leah Millis/Reuters]  17:35 ET – Trump: Coronavirus vaccine likely to be approved in October  “We’re very close to that vaccine as you know, closer than most people want to say or certainly than most people understand,” President Trump said at a White House news conference.  Trump said a vaccine for the coronavirus could be announced as soon as October. White House virus adviser Scott Atlas said the first doses for “high-priority” recipients would come in January.  “To get the vaccine in the hands of American people, we’re fully mobilizing the awesome power of American industry and also our military,” Trump said.  “I’m calling on Biden to stop promoting his anti-vaccine theories because all they’re doing is hurting the importance of what we’re doing,” he said.  Separately, the Trump administration released a sweeping plan to distribute vaccines free to the public when one becomes available. Congress had including funding for the plan in coronavirus legislation.  16:45 ET – Biden: Trump’s virus response ‘utterly disqualifying’ for presidency  Biden has said Trump’s coronavirus response has been “utterly disqualifying” for the presidency, while reiterating he would sign an executive order for a national mask mandate if he has the power as president to do so.  “The president’s first responsibility is to protect the American people, and he won’t. And it’s utterly disqualifying,” Biden said during a speech on his coronavirus response plan.  Biden also said that he did not believe his concerns over a vaccine developed under Trump would discourage citizens from eventually getting a vaccine, saying, instead, his suggested reviews would make people more confident.  He added that he thinks front line health workers and those at the highest risk should be the first to get the vaccine, while doubling down that he would seek to mandate a national mask requirement.  We all want a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, but it needs to be based on science — not politics. Tune in as I discuss how we can develop and equitably distribute a safe and effective vaccine: https://t.co/KPxTaqAiVd — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 16, 2020  16:30 ET – Biden says Trump, on his own, should not be trusted on vaccine  Biden has said Trump, on his own, should not be trusted on a coronavirus vaccine, but said he would trust a vaccine developed under Trump’s watch if approved by non-partisan scientists.  Trump has repeatedly said a vaccine could be ready before the election, despite experts saying that developing a safe vaccine in that timeline is extremely unlikely.  “Scientific breakthroughs don’t care about calendars any more than the virus does,” Biden said during a speech in Wilmington, Delaware. “They certainly don’t adhere to election cycles and their timing their approval and their distribution should never ever be distorted by political considerations.”  “Let me be clear. I trust vaccines, I trust scientists, but I don’t trust Donald Trump. At this moment the American people can’t either,” Biden said, adding a vaccine developed by Trump would need to answer three questions: What criteria will be used to ensure that a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety? Who will validate the development was driven by science and not politics? And how will safe distribution be assured?  16:15 ET – Biden slams Trump’s town hall comments  Biden has slammed Trump’s comments on the coronavirus made during Tuesday night’s town hall.  During the Philadelphia event, Trump denied that he intentionally down-played the virus in the early days of the pandemic, as detailed in recorded interviews with reporter Bob Woodward. Trump instead told undecided voters he “up-played” the virus and hailed his administration as doing a “tremendous job” in responding to the pandemic.  “This virus is still taking nearly 1,000 lives a day. Forecast show that those numbers are likely to climb this winter, but incredibly Donald Trump insists that he wouldn’t have done anything differently,” Biden said on Wednesday.  “All President Trump had to offer last night was the same weak and feckless action, the same lies and empty promises that we’ve seen from the very beginning,” he said.

Eberhart said: “Frankly, I expected President Trump to be better prepared to cajole undecided voters over to his side of the fence at the town hall.”  He added: “President Trump seemed unaware that he needed to downshift his rhetoric to something more moderate being as how his audience was undecided voters and not attendees of one of his rallies”.  14:45 ET – The Take podcast: How will Black women voters affect the election?  Biden kept his vow of choosing a woman as his running mate, selecting Senator Kamala Harris.  Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, is the first Black woman on a major party ticket in US history.

The video, which appeared to show Biden playing rap group NWA’s song, “F— tha Police,” now displays a warning that links to collated tweets showing the actual event, where Biden pulled out his phone to play Luis Fonsi’s hit “Despacito” at a Hispanic Heritage Month event in Florida after being introduced by Fonsi.  Trump has cast himself as a “law-and-order” president during the campaign, in response to widespread protests, most of them peaceful, following the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis. He tweeted with the edited video: “What is this all about?”  A Twitter spokeswoman said the video, which garnered more than 2.8 million views, was labeled based on its synthetic and manipulated media policy.

In November, Witzke will challenge incumbent Senator Chris Coons, who easily won the Democratic primary and is expected to win handily in the deeply blue state.  Witzke, who worked as an Iowa field operator for President Donald Trump last year, defeated attorney James DeMartino, a former marine who has twice run unsuccessfully for the legislative seat held by Delaware’s Democratic state House speaker.  Witzke has tried to distance herself from accusations by some opponents that she supports QAnon. The far-right conspiracy theory centres on an alleged anonymous, high-ranking government official known as “Q”, who shares information about “deep state” enemies of Trump often tied to child sex trafficking.

Two of the advertisements feature parents, a mother in Texas and a father in Arizona, who recount their experience having a child with a pre-existing condition.

Biden will deliver remarks in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, after being briefed by public health experts on the efforts to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  Biden has continually attacked what he describes as Trump’s mishandling of the pandemic. While he has said he wants a vaccine as soon as safely possible, he has questioned whether Trump is pressuring drug safety agencies to fast-track an inoculant before the November 3 election.  At a Philadelphia town hall on Tuesday, Trump again asserted a vaccine could be available within a month, despite health experts saying such a timeline is extremely unlikely.  09:00 ET – White House seeks to clarify Trump ‘herd mentality’ statement  White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany has sought to clarify statements made by Trump during a Tuesday town hall in which he said the virus would go away over a period of time as “herd mentality” would develop.  McEnany, in an interview on Fox News, said Trump was referring to “herd immunity”.  “Well, the term ‘herd immunity’ is a medical term which means that when you have a certain percentage of a population with antibodies, you have herd immunity,” McEnany said. “It can be done via a vaccine or via prior illness that you develop the antibodies.”  “What the president said very clearly there is that a vaccine gets you there quickest,” she said.  _______________________________________________________________  Hello and welcome to Al Jazeera’s continuing coverage of the US elections.
