Washington (CNN) President-elect Joe Biden is set to announce who will serve in top roles in his administration in the coming days and weeks.  Biden announced on November 23 several key members of his foreign policy and national security teams. He named Antony Blinken as his choice for secretary of state, Alejandro Mayorkas as secretary of homeland security, Avril Haines as director of national intelligence, Linda Thomas-Greenfield as US ambassador to the United Nations, Jake Sullivan as national security adviser and John Kerry as special presidential envoy for climate.  He had already announced that Ron Klain , one of his most trusted campaign advisers, will serve as his incoming chief of staff. And Jen O'Malley Dillon , Biden's campaign manager, and Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a co-chair of Biden's transition team and presidential campaign, will serve in top roles in the White House.  Each of Biden's Cabinet nominees will need to be confirmed by the US Senate, which is currently controlled by Republicans. Two runoff elections in Georgia on January 5 could determine which party controls the chamber and impact the Cabinet confirmation process.  The Cabinet includes the vice president and the heads of 15 executive departments: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs.  Several key positions also have Cabinet-level rank: White House chief of staff, Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Office of Management & Budget director, United States Trade Representative ambassador, Council of Economic Advisers chairman and Small Business Administration administrator.  This list will be updated based on conversations with Biden allies and advisers and Democrats with knowledge of the matter.  Here's who has been mentioned in conversations about potential top roles in the Biden administration:  Secretary of State  Antony Blinken (announced November 23)  US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken takes part in a naturalization ceremony on World Refugee Day on June 20, 2016, in Washington, DC.  Blinken served in the Obama administration as the deputy secretary of state, assistant to the president and principal deputy national security adviser. He served as the national security adviser to then-Vice President Biden and deputy assistant to the president during Obama's first term. He has been a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the Democratic staff director at the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.  During the Clinton administration, Blinken served as a member of the National Security Council staff at the White House, and held roles as the special assistant to the president, senior director for European affairs, and senior director for speechwriting and then strategic planning. He was Clinton's chief foreign policy speechwriter. Blinken was also being considered as national security adviser.  Chris Coons  Sen. Chris Coons asks a question to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as he testifies during a Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing on July 30, 2020.  Coons currently occupies the same Delaware Senate seat that Biden held for decades. A longtime Biden ally, Coons was one of the first members of Congress to endorse the former vice president when he declared his 2020 presidential candidacy. Coons sits on the following committees in the Senate: Foreign Relations, Appropriations, Judiciary, Small Business & Entrepreneurship and Select Committee on Ethics. Throughout his Senate career, Coons has been known for working across the aisle and forging strong relationships with high-profile Republicans who shared common interests.  Susan Rice  Former national security advisor Susan Rice arrives to speak at the J Street 2018 National Conference on April 16, 2018 in Washington, DC.  Rice served in the Obama administration as UN ambassador and national security adviser. She served in Clinton's administration as the special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the White House, the assistant secretary for the Bureau of African Affairs at the State Department and the director of international organizations and peacekeeping at the National Security Council. Rice was one of a handful of women on Biden's shortlist for a running mate.  Rice at one point was thought to be the clear choice to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, but in 2012 withdrew her name from consideration to avoid a bitter Senate confirmation battle. Rice was the target of Republican criticism after comments she made on Sunday morning TV shows defending the Obama administration's handling of the September 11, 2012, attacks on the Benghazi consulate that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.  Secretary of the Treasury  Janet Yellen  Yellen is expected to be named Treasury secretary, according to a source with knowledge of the pick. Yellen's selection would be historic, as she would be the first woman named to the post. She served as chair of the Federal Reserve Board from 2014 to 2018. She previously served for four years as the vice chair of the board, and president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for four years prior to that. Yellen was also chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 1997 to 1999.  Lael Brainard  US Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard attends a "Fed Listens" event at the Federal Reserve headquarters on October 4, 2019, in Washington, DC.

She previously served as the Under Secretary of the US Department of the Treasury and counselor to the secretary of the Treasury during the Obama administration. Brainard was the US representative to the G-20 Finance Deputies and G-7 Deputies and was a member of the Financial Stability Board. During the Clinton administration, Brainard served as the deputy national economic adviser and deputy assistant to the President. She also served as Clinton's personal representative to the G-7/G-8.  If chosen, the Federal Reserve governor would be the first woman to hold the powerful position. Brainard is not quite a consensus pick. Party progressives have other favorites, but neither would her nomination set off the kind of internal ideological war the incoming administration surely wants to avoid.  Sarah Bloom Raskin  US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Sarah Bloom Raskin attends the opening ceremony of the APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting in Beijing on October 22, 2014.  Raskin was the deputy secretary of the US Department of the Treasury during the Obama administration. She was previously a governor of the Federal Reserve Board. Prior to joining the Federal Reserve Board, Raskin was the commissioner of financial regulation for the state of Maryland.  Outside of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Raskin, a former deputy secretary at the department, would be the top choice for most progressives. That she is less well known to the wider political world could also work in favor.  Secretary of Defense  Tammy Duckworth  Sen. Tammy Duckworth speaks at a Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation hearing on stakeholder perspectives on trucking in America.  Duckworth is the junior senator from Illinois. An Iraq war veteran, Duckworth was the first Thai-American woman elected to Congress, the first female double-amputee in the US Senate and the first senator to give birth while in office.  Duckworth was appointed by then-Gov. Rod Blagojevich to head the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs after running for Congress unsuccessfully in 2006. She served in the position for three years, and then in 2009, then-President Barack Obama appointed Duckworth as the assistant secretary of the US Department of Veterans Affairs.  Mich√®le Flournoy  Michele Flournoy, president of the Center for a New American Security, looks on during a conference on the transition of the US presidency from Obama to Trump on January 10, 2017, in Washington, DC.  If chosen and confirmed, Flournoy would be the first female secretary of defense. She served as the under secretary of defense for policy under Obama. Prior to her confirmation, Flournoy helped lead Obama's transition team at the Defense Department. During the mid-1990's, she served as principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and threat reduction, as well as deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy. She co-founded the Center for a New American Security, a bipartisan think tank, and WestExec Advisors, a strategic advisory firm.

While at USCIS, Mayorkas oversaw the implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was an executive action under Obama that protected young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation.

Sally Yates  Former acting US Attorney General Sally Yates testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on May 8, 2017, in Washington, DC.  Yates was fired by Trump from her role as acting attorney general. The stunning move came after CNN and other outlets reported that Yates told Justice Department lawyers not to make legal arguments defending Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees. Trump's executive order, signed in January 2017, barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for the following 90 days, suspended the admission of all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely suspended the Syrian refugee program. The executive order was later blocked by a federal judge, but the Supreme Court ultimately upheld a revised version of the ban.  Yates had been appointed by Obama and was set to serve until Trump's nominee for attorney general was confirmed.  Secretary of the Interior  Deb Haaland  Rep.

His campaign slogan was "MATH," or "Make America Think Harder." Yang joined CNN as a political commentator in February, after dropping out of the presidential race.  Secretary of Labor  Andy Levin  Rep. Andy Levin, a Michigan Democrat, conducts a news conference on February 6, 2020.  Levin is a popular progressive who is also growing his base of support with labor leaders, including at the Communications Workers of America. The United Auto Workers and National Nurses United unions are backing the Michigan congressman for the role. Like Walsh, Levin has a background as an organizer with major unions.

Bernie Sanders  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at the Convention Center in Los Angeles, California, on March 1, 2020.  Sanders is reaching out to potential supporters in labor to ask for their support as he mounts a campaign for the job. But he is viewed as a long shot and so far has received mix reactions from labor leaders. In his public comments before and after the election, he focused on a 100-day agenda for the Congress. But with Democrats likely needing to win both Georgia runoffs to take control of the Senate, running a powerful agency might have become more appealing.  Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday that if Biden asked him to join his Cabinet as Labor secretary, he would accept the nomination. "If I had a portfolio that allowed me to stand up and fight for working families, would I do it? Yes, I would," Sanders said.  Marty Walsh  Boston Mayor Marty Walsh speaks at a press conference on March 13, 2020, in Boston, Massachusetts.  Walsh is the mayor of Boston, and is AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka's pick for the job, a big endorsement in what could soon turn into a contentious debate between moderate Democrats and progressives, who will favor Sen. Bernie Sanders or Michigan Rep. Andy Levin. Walsh grew up in a union family and became a top Boston labor leader before being elected mayor.  Health and Human Services Secretary  Michelle Lujan Grisham  Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham speaks during a news conference on immigration outside the US Capitol on June 13, 2018, in Washington, DC.

He worked in the Clinton administration as an adviser to the President.  Emanuel's record in Chicago could be a major hurdle to confirmation in the Senate, particularly among progressives, considering the city's crime rate and the 2014 police shooting of Laquan McDonald, which is the leading reason he did not seek a third term as mayor.  Eric Garcetti  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti speaks at a Los Angeles County Health Department press conference on the novel coronavirus on March 4, 2020, in Los Angeles, California.
