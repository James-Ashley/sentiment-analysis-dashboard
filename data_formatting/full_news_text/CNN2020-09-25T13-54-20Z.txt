(CNN) Three years after its last edition, "Fargo" returns with Chris Rock and Jason Schwartzman in key against-type roles, and an enticing mob story with the texture of a graphic novel. Yet it unfolds at such a languid, almost hypnotic pace as to blunt its impact, getting distracted by an abundance of oddball characters that don't overtly do much to advance the central plot.  The FX series was one of many delayed by coronavirus, having completed nine of its 11 episodes before the pandemic shut down production. Series creator Noah Hawley and his team were able to resume filming , although those final episodes haven't been seen, so even critics don't know if the big build-up actually pays off in a satisfying manner.  As is, the new "Fargo" owes a debt to every Mafia movie ever made, but perhaps foremost to the graphic-novel-turned-2002-movie "Road to Perdition," at least in the look and tone. A key dramatic device also brings to mind Jack Kirby's epic "Fourth World" comic books of the 1970s: Leaders of warring factions (and in that case, planets) swapping sons in order to maintain an uneasy truce between them.  The premiere establishes that history, and indeed the entire arc of American organized crime as it pertains to immigrants, with the rise of Jewish, Irish and Italian syndicates -- whoever was "next off the boat," it's noted. These groups warily interact with each other, before Black mobsters enter the scene when the story begins in Kansas City in 1950, with Rock's Loy Cannon as their boss. (Lest anyone have forgotten after the long layoff, "Fargo," the title, is really just a state of mind, not the town referred to in the original Coen brothers movie.)  "What does history tell us? Peace don't last for long," the narration notes at the outset, setting an ominous tone for virtually everything that follows.
