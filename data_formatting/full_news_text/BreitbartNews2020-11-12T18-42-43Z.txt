China urged the U.S. to ‚Äúroot out systematic racism‚Äù at the United Nations (U.N.) on Monday. Beijing‚Äôs exhortation comes amid mounting evidence that the Communist Party has imprisoned as many as 3 million ethnic minorities in concentration camps in an effort to erase them from society.  ‚ÄúThe Chinese delegation wishes to recommend to the U.S. [the following]: ‚Ä¶ Root out systematic racism, address widespread police brutality and combat discrimination against African- and Asian-Americans,‚Äù Beijing‚Äôs representative said at the U.N.

Member States,‚Äù the UNHRC explains on its official website. ‚ÄúThe UPR is a State-driven process, under the auspices of the Human Rights Council, which provides the opportunity for each State to declare what actions they have taken to improve the human rights situations in their countries and to fulfil their human rights obligations.‚Äù  Testimonies from people who have escaped China‚Äôs Xinjiang concentration camp system suggest that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has imprisoned 1 million to 3 million ethnic minorities, mostly Uyghurs, in concentration camps in the past four years in northwestern Xinjiang. Satellite evidence indicates that the CCP began building the camps around 2017. The CCP refers to the camps as ‚Äúvocational training centers‚Äù meant to educate prisoners, but survivors say they endured or witnessed extreme torture, indoctrination, rape, forced sterilization, and other crimes against humanity.  The culture of Xinjiang‚Äôs native minorities differs greatly from that of China‚Äôs ruling ethnic Han majority. Uyghurs, Kyrgyz, and Kazakhs are majority Sunni Muslim and speak Turkic languages. The CCP views Xinjiang‚Äôs cultural differences as a threat to the party‚Äôs dominant power, which is consolidated within the ethnic Han culture. The party has resorted to extreme measures to assimilate Xinjiang‚Äôs minorities into Han culture through its detention camp system. Survivors of the camps say they were subjected to Communist Party political indoctrination, forced into slave labor, and endured physical and sexual abuse, among other human rights abuses.  Xinjiang‚Äôs Turkic ethnic groups are not the only minorities targeted by CCP discrimination. Human rights watchers have accused the Communist Party of racist attitudes and actions against African immigrants in China as well. Authorities in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in April enforced evictions of African migrants residing in the city for work, citing unfounded concern from locals that black people were more likely to carry and transmit the Chinese coronavirus than Han Chinese people. Municipal CCP officials allowed local business owners to deny Africans entry to hotels, forcing many to sleep on the street.
