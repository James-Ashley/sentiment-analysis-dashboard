Authorities with the U.K. Border Force have seized 1.9 million British pounds – or roughly $2.48 million – that a passenger at London’s Heathrow Airport was allegedly trying to move in an apparent money laundering scheme.  Tara Hanlon, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, was arrested on Oct. 3 while waiting to board a flight to Dubai, the U.K. Border Force confirmed in a news release. Authorities searched her bags and confiscated the stacks of cash, which amounted to the largest cash seizure by the force in all of 2020.

Hanlon was ultimately charged with money laundering; the other woman was released amid the investigation.
