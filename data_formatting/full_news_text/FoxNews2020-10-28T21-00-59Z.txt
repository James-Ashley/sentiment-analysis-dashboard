This week, Liz is joined by the first woman of color CEO of AT&T Business, Anne Chow to discuss how her background of hard work and personal experiences of being discriminated against continue to bolster her leadership style of empathy and equity at AT&T.  As a child, Anne learned the importance of discipline and grit as her immigrant Taiwanese parents encouraged her to audition for the Julliard school of music at just ten years old. Throughout her life, education would continue to prove paramount, as Anne pursued degrees from Cornell University in business and engineering. Today, after more than three decades at the company, Anne is the CEO of AT&T Business. She is also the co-author of "The Leader's Guide to Unconscious Bias," alongside Pamela Fuller & Mark Murphy.
