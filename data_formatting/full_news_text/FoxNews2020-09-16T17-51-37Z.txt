Two of the suspects, identified as Raul Paz-Perez and Wilmer Paz-Perez, were in the country illegally and arrested Saturday on first-degree rape involving a juvenile under the age of 13.

The three men offered the girl money but she refused, running into the bathroom and locking the door. The men forced their way inside and raped her, police said.  Detectives are also looking into allegations that Elder Paz-Perez sexually assaulted the 10-year-old's 15-year-old sister after she told authorities about an incident that had allegedly taken place a few years earlier.  Two stepsiblings of the 10-year-old girl are also being interviewed by detectives, Lt. Michael Cunningham told The New York Post.
