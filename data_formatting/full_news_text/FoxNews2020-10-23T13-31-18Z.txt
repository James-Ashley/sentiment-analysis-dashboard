Alyssa Milano reacted to the final presidential debate on Thursday by claiming that a vote to reelect President Trump is essentially a vote against America.  The former "Charmed" actress, an outspoken critic of Trump, posted a series of tweets after the event and said the Democratic nominee Joe Biden "won" the debate.  "I'm voting for @JoeBiden because he is so good for America. His platform is centered around lifting people up and fixing the problems keeping us down. #WhyILoveJoe #Debate2020," she wrote on Twitter.  "Hope over fear. Love over hate," she said in another tweet.  ‘CHARMED’ STAR SARAH JEFFERY CALLS HOLLY MARIE COMBS, ROSE MCGOWAN ‘PATHETIC’ FOR CRITICIZING REBOOT  She also summarized what she believes what the Nov. 3 presidential election boils down to.

".@joeBiden cares about American lives and their livelihoods. Trump doesn't care if we live or die," the actress wrote.
