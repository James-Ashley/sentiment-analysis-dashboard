(CNN) The United Nations has warned that millions of children are still cut off from aid in Ethiopia's conflict-riven Tigray region, despite promises made by the federal government earlier this month to allow humanitarian agencies access.  Some 2.3 million minors are struggling to get basic humanitarian assistance like treatment for malnourishment, critical vaccines, emergency medicines, and water and sanitation supplies, UNICEF, the UN agency responsible for children, said Tuesday.  "We are extremely concerned that the longer access to them is delayed, the worse their situation will become as supplies of food, including ready-to-use therapeutic food for the treatment of child malnutrition, medicines, water, fuel and other essentials run low," UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore said in a statement.  The conflict between government forces and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) began in early November and threatens to undo years of progress in Africa's second most populous country, as well as the wider Horn of Africa region. Over 50,000 Ethiopian refugees have now crossed into Sudan, according to the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, of which nearly half are children.  UNICEF called for "urgent, sustained, unconditional and impartial humanitarian access" to the families affected and urged the Ethiopian government to allow the free movement of civilians wishing to seek safety elsewhere.
