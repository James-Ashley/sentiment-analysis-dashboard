(CNN) House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said Saturday that he had privately urged President-elect Joe Biden to pick a Black woman as his running mate before Biden chose Kamala Harris, America's first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president-elect.  "Joe and I talked about it several times when he was trying to make his decision," Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat who's the highest-ranking African American member of Congress, told CNN's Dana Bash on Saturday. "He had said it would be a woman. And I don't mind saying now, I said to him in private that I thought that a lot of the results would turn on whether that woman (would) be a Black woman."  Clyburn's comments came hours after CNN projected that Biden will become the 46th president of the United States as a victory in Pennsylvania, the state where he was born, put him over the 270 electoral votes needed to win. According to exit polls , 91% of Black female voters backed Biden, compared with 8% for President Donald Trump. Exit polls are still being updated as votes come in; these numbers reflect the most recent data.  Clyburn told Bash on Saturday that he did not give that advice publicly at the time so as not to "diminish" Biden. "I gave all my advice to him in private. But I'm very pleased that it was a Black woman selected -- I think it cemented his relationship to the Black community."  Read More Rep.
