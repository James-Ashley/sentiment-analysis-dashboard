In Georgia, I was casting a vote for the change that I so desperately want to see in this country.  Twenty years ago, I came to the US from the Himalayan country of Nepal to pursue my master's in social work. After graduation, I worked as an advocate for survivors of gender-based violence in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
