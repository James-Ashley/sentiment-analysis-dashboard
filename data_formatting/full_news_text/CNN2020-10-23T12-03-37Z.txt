President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at The Villages Polo Club on October 23 in The Villages, Florida. Evan Vucci/AP  President Trump continues to project an optimistic tone about the coronavirus, a tone that is out of touch with reality as cases surge throughout the country.  “We're going to quickly end this pandemic, this horrible plague that came in from China,” Trump said at a rally at The Villages in Florida on Friday. “Normal life will fully resume. We had the greatest economy in our history and next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country.”  Earlier in the rally, Trump criticized Joe Biden for only wanting to talk about coronavirus and again claimed the US is “rounding the turn.”  “You look at what is going on and we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner. We're rounding the corner beautifully,” Trump said.  Some context: On Thursday, there were more than 71,000 new coronavirus cases in the US, the worst day since the summer.  Trump has attempted to project an optimistic tone on the pandemic since it first began.  Since February, he has said that the virus will simply disappear at least 38 times, though his “rounding the turn” rhetoric is slightly different from that. The latest on the 2020 election
