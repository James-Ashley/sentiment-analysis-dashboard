He has now claimed Covid-19 is "in most populations far less lethal!!!" than the flu. That's not true. Here are the facts.  In just eight months, Covid-19 has killed more Americans than the flu did during the last five flu seasons combined.  The novel coronavirus is also much more contagious than the flu. While research shows that someone with the flu infects an average of about 1.28 other people, someone with Covid-19 infects an average of about 2 to 3 other people when mitigation efforts such as stay-at-home orders or masks are not in place.  On top of that, the coronavirus can be spread for many days without symptoms. The incubation period for the flu is much shorter, meaning people are likely to start feeling sick earlier and avoid contact with others.  There's also a vaccine available for the flu and experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got flu shots.
