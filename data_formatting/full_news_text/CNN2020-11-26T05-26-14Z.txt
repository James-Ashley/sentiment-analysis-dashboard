He and his family are quarantining for 14 days because three of his children came into contact with a state highway patrol officer who later tested positive for Covid-19. The Newsom family, so far, has tested negative for the virus. But being stuck indoors does give the Golden State governor ample time to think about one of the most consequential decisions he will make during his tenure: who he will appoint to replace Kamala Harris, once she resigns her Senate seat to assume the vice-presidency.  Raul A. Reyes  Newsom should name a Latino to represent California in the Senate. This would be a historic moment for the state, for Latinos, and for the nation. There are a number of qualified candidates for the job. And such an appointment would help ensure that Latinos are represented at the highest levels of government.  Since California joined the union in 1850, it has never had a Latino senator. Not one in its 170 years of history, despite the fact that today, the state is nearly 40% Hispanic or Latino . Consider that California is home to more Latinos than any other state ( 15 million ), and that they make up a majority of the state's K-12 students. By naming a Latino as Harris's successor, Newsom would demonstrate a genuine commitment to diversity and inclusion. This is who should get Kamala Harris's Senate seat
