The fingerprints of Manchester Arena concert bomber Salman Abedi’s father, who came to Britain as a refugee, were found inside the car used to store the explosives.  Ramadan Abedi, who reportedly belonged to the al-Qaeda linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) in the 1990s, was accepted into Britain as a refugee after the North African country former ruler, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, cracked down on Islamic radicals, returning to the country after the regime change intervention spearheaded by Barack Obama and David Cameron toppled him,  Ramadan’s son, Salman, would go on to carry out a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, killing and maiming hundreds of people — many of them children, teenagers, and their parents. Salman’s brother Hashem was also convicted of involvement in the radical Islamic terror attack earlier this year, with a judge ruling he “equally culpable” for it and handing him a “life” sentence with a minimum term of 55 years before he can be considered for parole.  Now the authorities have revealed that the police would like to question Ramadan himself over the attack, as his fingerprints were inside the car which became “a de facto storage facility for the various items of bomb-making equipment” for his sons — but they cannot do so, as he remains in Libya.

The other wanted suspects named at the inquiry were Samia Tabbal, the terrorists’ mother, and Mohammed Soliman and Elyas Elmehdi, friends of the brothers accused of acquiring sulphuric acid for them and helping to the explosives-concealings car, respectively.
