SEE NEW POSTS  4 takeaways from the last presidential debate of 2020 It was probably as normal as things could get this election cycle. After the last faceoff turned into a name-calling shouting match, Thursday night's presidential debate, moderated by NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker, resembled a much more traditional matchup and provided one the clearest contrasts yet between President Trump and his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, on everything from race to the environment. Here are four key takeaways.

Janez Janša is an anti-immigration hardliner who has been compared to Trump.

The letter includes several prominent members of the military community. "When the White House threatens to use the military to ‘dominate’ the streets, he pits our service members against their peaceful fellow citizens and the First Amendment," the letter states. "When our foreign policy abandons allies we have fought side-by-side with for years – as happened with the Kurds in Syria – Donald Trump makes a mockery of the loyalty that we prize." Trump has touted his support among members of the military, a voting bloc that helped him win swing states like North Carolina in 2016.

The final debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden was a departure from the rancorous first clash in Cleveland. Instead, the two presidential hopefuls sparred on the federal Covid-19 response, health care, immigration policy and race. With polls showing Biden holding a sizable national lead — with Election Day just two weeks away and over 42 million ballots already cast — Trump delivered no obvious knockout blows and the Democrat appeared to clear his final major hurdle with no major stumble.
