Zurich, Switzerland Swiss voters will decide on Sunday whether to tear up a pact with the European Union on the free movement of people, after a referendum campaign that exposed rifts in society over foreigners who make up a quarter of the population.  The right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) -- the biggest in parliament -- is leading the charge to seize back control of immigration, echoing some of the arguments pro-Brexit politicians used in the run-up to Britain's exit from the EU.
