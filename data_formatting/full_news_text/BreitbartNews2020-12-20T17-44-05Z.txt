Agents arrested 7,951 single adults in November 2020 compared to 1,793 in November 2019, the report states. This marks an increase in the arrest of single adults of more than 340 percent.  The nearly 8,000 single adults arrested in this single border sector represents more than 13 percent of the 61,000 single adults arrested along the entire southwestern border with Mexico.  “There has been a significant increase in arrests of single adults attempting to illegally enter the United States in our area of responsibility,” said Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Austin L. Skero II. “The men and women of Del Rio Sector work to detect, deter, and apprehend anyone seeking to violate the immigration laws of the United States.”  Following their arrest, all apprehended migrants undergo a medical screening and criminal background investigation. Once cleared, they are nearly immediately expelled to Mexico under Title 42 coronavirus protection protocols put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Information obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows that about 90 percent of apprehended migrants are expelled within two hours of their arrest.
