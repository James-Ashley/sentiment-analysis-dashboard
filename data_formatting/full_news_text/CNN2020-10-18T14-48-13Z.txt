(CNN) Tensions between protesters, federal officers and Portland police escalated Saturday night outside a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in the city.  Protesters gathered at Willamette Park before moving to the ICE building and surrounding neighborhoods, CNN affiliate KATU reported.  About 100 people outside the building were chanting when Federal Protective Service officers came out to face protesters around 10 p.m. local time, KATU reported.  Portland police had warned they would use "impact weapons, tear gas and/or OC munitions" if people refused to leave roadways or stay off ICE property.  Officers from the Portland Police Bureau were also on scene issuing warnings to the crowd to move away from the federal officers and the ICE building.  Police accused the crowd of throwing rocks and incendiary devices at officers while apologizing to nearby residents for the noise in a series of tweets.
