Sen. Kamala Harris' facial expressions while Vice President Mike Pence was responding to questions about the administration's Covid-19 response during Wednesday's debate were a hit across social media. And Asian Twitter and Black Twitter put their own spin on it.  Many joked that Harris, who's the first Black person and the first Indian American to appear on the vice presidential debate stage, was giving looks reminiscent of a disapproving auntie.  Kamala is the descendant of TWO auntie lineages. Pence is only so calm because he has no idea wtf this eyebrow raise means. pic.twitter.com/HhsqFBuFYp — Tiffany Liao (@Tiff_Liao) October 8, 2020  Kamala is channeling the look of 1000 disapproving Asian Aunties, and I’m here for it. #VPDebate @KamalaHarris 👏👏 pic.twitter.com/gwnlDbIkaI — Leslie Toy (@ltoy_Health) October 8, 2020  I want to learn how to nod my head affirmatively while saying words the way Auntie Kamala does. I say Auntie, because that is clearly an Auntie move. #VPDebate — Taz Ahmed (@TazzyStar) October 8, 2020  Anyone complaining about Kamala Harris’s face is clearly white cause every black person in America has seen ALL those faces from they mom sister or they aunty — Tommy (@DaleThompsonNB) October 8, 2020  Kamala Harris is really bringing out her desi side with those glares of judgement — 💎𝑯𝒆𝒆𝒓𝒂💎 (@hxxrraa) October 8, 2020  Kamala is giving me Jamaican auntie vibes.

That's what happens when your whole ensemble is on fleek. That's what happens when you use the right hair products.

The anecdotes mostly focus on their immigrant families' resilience. Harris has often referred to her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, as her inspiration. Gopalan grew up in South India and immigrated to the U.S. in 1958 to pursue a doctorate degree.  Me & mama. We’re with you @KamalaHarris. Knowing how hard my mama fought for us to have the life we had, now getting to see you shine tonight. Never in our wildest dreams. These 2 very loud Indians will be cheering. Loudly. Sorry to all nearby. We’re so. SO. Loud. 😳 #AAPISheRose pic.twitter.com/RcXFKfGD33 — Sarayu Blue (@sarayublue) October 7, 2020  On the eve of the VP Debate with @KamalaHarris , I honor and remember Kalpana Chawla— a brilliant Indian-American astronaut who forged new frontiers. We will break every mold. #AAPISheRose #VPDebate #vote h/t @thatalicewu pic.twitter.com/Jil7YYh7Rs — Min Jin Lee (@minjinlee11) October 7, 2020  My mother, soon after coming to the USA. Linda Kim Nguyen was a refugee twice, and a self-made woman twice. She rose, and she rose.    In her memory, I stand with @KamalaHarris, who I'm sure had to be twice as good as Mike Pence to get to the #VPDebate. #AAPISheRose @AAPI_Biden pic.twitter.com/ThhxG1qCJZ — viet thanh nguyen (@viet_t_nguyen) October 7, 2020 Asian Twitter, Black Twitter joke about Harris' disapproving auntie vibe
