(CNN) President Donald Trump announced a two-page second-term vision for the Hispanic American community -- the "American Dream Plan" -- to rallygoers in Arizona on Wednesday, six days before Election Day.  "Over the next four years, the American Dream Plan will bring more than 2 million new jobs to Hispanic communities, create over a half a million new Hispanic-owned small businesses -- which will end up being large businesses if I know you, and I know you well," Trump said in Goodyear, Arizona.  The President also said the plan would "expand opportunities for federal contracting" and would "increase access to capital by hundreds of billions of dollars."  The plan -- a White House document that the White House's press office deferred to the Trump campaign on for comment -- is a two-page, bullet-pointed summary of ambitious but largely general goals, ranging from the economy to education to immigration.  Among the goals: to "instill policies to add 500,000 Hispanic-owned businesses," "empower every family in America with school choice now" and "streamline the process to increase the number of Hispanic Serving Institutions."
