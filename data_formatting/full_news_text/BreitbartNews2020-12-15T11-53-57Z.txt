A Pakistani migrant drug dealer in Athens has been accused of taking two teenaged girls prisoner before drugging them both and raping one in his apartment.  Police stated the girls, Greeks aged 16 and 17, had claimed that the man had held them captive in his fifth-floor apartment and had threatened them with violence, saying he would kill them if they tried to leave.  According to a report from Greek newspaper Proto Thema, the migrant raped one of the girls, while violently assaulting the other.

Police found the teens, who were being pursued by the half-naked man. Officers then subdued and arrested the drug dealer.  During a search of the apartment, police found 49 packages of cannabis, 70 pills of the date-rape drug Rohypnol, and an undisclosed amount of heroin. Police believe the man sold the drugs on the streets of Athens.  The case comes just weeks after Greek police in the capital undertook a manhunt for another migrant, also believed to be Pakistani, who raped a woman while wrapping a thick metal chain around her neck to subdue her.
