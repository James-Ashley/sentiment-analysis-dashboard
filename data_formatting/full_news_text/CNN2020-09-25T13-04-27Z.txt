(CNN) When Judaline Cassidy first tried to join the plumbers union in New York City, a seasoned union man told her to "go home and do dishes."  "Being a woman in a male-dominated space, especially being a Black immigrant woman with an accent and really small in stature, sometimes people doubt what you are capable of," Judaline Cassidy told CNN. " But this is the important part of the story; later on, he (the seasoned union man) became one of my biggest supporters."  Cassidy became the first woman to join that union. And now, more than 20 years later, she's the first woman to be elected to the union's examining board.  "Plumbers come in all sizes and colors and a lot of them look like me now. And that's what I'm trying to change-- that stereotype."  Eager to share her knowledge and help raise the low percentage of women in construction trades, Cassidy created a program that puts tools in the hands of girls as young as six years old.
