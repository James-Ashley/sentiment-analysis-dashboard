(CNN) The Department of Homeland Security inspector general declined to investigate whether acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and his deputy Ken Cuccinelli are serving in their roles lawfully, saying its efforts on the issue would be "pointless."  In its report, the GAO referred the legality of actions taken by Wolf and Cuccinelli, as well as the question over who should be serving in the top two roles, to the DHS inspector general.  The inspector general's decision comes after a federal judge in Maryland ruled that Wolf is likely unlawfully serving as acting secretary and leaves the issue of leadership at the department at an impasse. In March, a different federal judge ruled that it was unlawful to appoint Cuccinelli, an immigration hardliner, to lead the agency responsible for processing US immigration requests.  However, both Wolf and Cuccinelli remain in their positions. Cuccinelli currently fills two leadership roles at DHS -- the senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary and the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services.
