1,666 Sussex County primary ballots counted two months later Presented by Masterworks  Good Tuesday morning!  Last week, a “mislabeled” bin containing 1,666 uncounted mail-in ballots from the July 7 primary was found at the Sussex County Board of Elections.  The ballots were counted on Saturday and miraculously did not affect the long-certified results of the election.  But when it comes to questions about the primarily mail-in election to be held in November, this isn’t a point in the governor’s favor. Nearly 1,700 ballots could easily help decide a local race or even a congressional race. And based on historical trends, voter turnout for the general election is going to be well over twice the primary.  Read more about it here .  WHERE’S MURPHY? — In South Amboy at 11 a.m. for a bridge groundbreaking.

WHAT TRENTON MADE    BILL TEXT TO BE READ BY MICROMACHINES GUY — McKeon says stock exchanges should enage on micro-cent tax proposal, by POLITICO’s Katherine Landergan: McKeon says that while these warehouses are paying things like property taxes, they are not employing many people, and so the impact wouldn’t be that great. Jared Walczak, who has studied this tax at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, agreed that these centers are not “employment heavy,” but said they are high paying jobs. New Jersey companies that do business with the data centers could also lose out, Walczak said. Walczak, who serves as the vice president of state projects, said the idea of taxing these transactions is a complex one. The actual trading floors are in New York, whereas the only activity happening in New Jersey is the digital processing of the transaction. Since the stock exchanges have servers elsewhere, it would be relatively “simple” for them to process transactions somewhere else, he said.  MCKNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR — Lawmaker to introduce new bill granting subpoena power to police review boards, by POLITICO’s Sam Sutton: Assemblymember Angela McKnight plans to introduce a new version of a bill that would allow civilian complaint review boards to subpoena records and investigate police officer misconduct concurrently with internal affairs units. The bill would also appropriate $600,000 for the Attorney General’s office to develop a training program for county or municipal review board members. Board members would be required to complete training prior to investigating officers or departments, according to a copy of the legislation provided to POLITICO. “To watch the killing of George Floyd nationally, so many people saw it, and then to read about the killing of Breonna Taylor, it did shine the light brightly [on police violence],” McKnight (D-Hudson) said in an interview late Monday afternoon. “Things happen for a reason ... and I pray for their families, but they’re not going to die in vain.”  FUNDS TO BE USED TO RENOVATE STATEHOUSE AFTER CHRISTIE’S RENOVATION IF MURPHY DOESN’T LIKE IT — “New Details on NJ borrowing plan as fight looms over tax estimates,” by NJ Spotlight’s John Reitmeyer: “According to budget documents and recent testimony during hearings before lawmakers, Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration is planning to use a 10-year repayment schedule for a total of $4 billion in new debt to help fund a nine-month budget he put forward last month. Annual interest on the bonds could be around 2%, and repayment would begin almost immediately at a cost of about $400 million annually in a full budget year, Department of Treasury officials told lawmakers last week. They also made a commitment to refrain from back-loading debt or using balloon payments, something that prior administrations have done to reduce short-term pain, even when it has driven up the total cost for future generations … The new details about the proposed borrowing suggest the Murphy administration is taking a restrained approach, at least initially ... But there are brewing concerns that the final decisions on borrowing will be made entirely behind closed doors”  —“NJ budget: Taxes, more debt, ballooning pensions and more undesirable choices on the table”  NO EVIDENCE OF KNOWLEDGE TRANSMISSION EITHER — “No evidence of in-classroom transmission as number of COVID-19 cases at N.J. schools rises, state says,” by NJ Advance Media’s Kelly Heyboer: “Though at least six New Jersey school districts have reported positive COVID-19 cases in the first two weeks of in-person classes, none of those cases are believed to be incidents where students or teachers caught the coronavirus in the classroom, state officials said Monday. Schools in Howell, Frankford, Little Silver, Chatham and Washington Township in Gloucester County and a county vocational school in East Brunswick have all switched to remote learning or asked some students to stay home due to positive COVID-19 cases. It is believed the students and teachers who tested positive all got the coronavirus outside of school and no one they came into contact with in the classroom has contracted COVID-19, Gov. Phil Murphy said at his coronavirus press briefing.”  —“Persichilli: NJ could have stopped COVID-19 sooner with Trump info”  —Persichilli: Federal funds can help offset proposed cuts to hospital charity care  —New Jersey to launch contact tracing pilot program on college campuses using digital app  IMMIGRATION — “’We’re just trying to survive.’ N.J.'s undocumented workers left out of coronavirus relief rally for aid,” by NJ Advance Medai’s Sophie Nieto-Munoz: “Six months ago, as the pandemic forced parts of the economy to shut down, companies started laying off and furloughing workers. In the months since, some of the state’s 9 million residents received a $1,200 stimulus check, applied for expanded unemployment benefits, and sought opportunities for aid through the federal Paycheck Protection Program or small business loans. But more than 722,000 residents who are not documented were left out of pandemic relief due to citizenship status, according to a new study released Monday by Make the Road New Jersey, an immigrant advocacy group that works closely with the Latino community.”  DANNY DEVITO URGED NOT TO INVITE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER TO N.J.— “N.J. preparing for ‘twin-demic’ with flu season piling on coronavirus outbreak, top health official says,” by NJ Advance Media’s Matt Arco: “New Jersey residents should get flu vaccinations as soon as possible to avoid a potential ‘twin-demic’ that could stress the state’s healthcare system if there’s also a spike in the coronavirus pandemic, the state’s top health official said Monday. “As we enter the fall season, we are also moving into the flu season. This year we are preparing for the possibility of a twin-demic," state Health Commissioners Judith Persichilli said.

But state emergency management officials say New Jersey school districts will be covered with a shipment of 2.4 million masks from the federal government. “As many students and teachers across our state and our country head back to school, FEMA’s policy will likely make it harder for state and local governments. This will hamstring efforts to slow the spread of the virus and prolong this pandemic,” a bipartisan group of New Jersey Congress members wrote in a letter to Peter Gaynor, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Eleven of the 12 members of New Jersey’s House delegation signed the letter. Only Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew did not.  KNIGHTS OF ROUND TABLE KNOW AN ARTHURIAN WHEN THEY SEE ONE — “I know an authoritarian when I see one,” by Bob Menendez for Univision: “In my 28 years in Congress, I have fought for democracy, freedom and human rights and against dictatorships around the globe—from China, to Cuba’s communist regime, to Maduro's socialist catastrophe. My family has lived under dictators in Cuba. I know an authoritarian when I see one. When the President of the United States calls the free press the enemy of the people, I hear the words of dictators. When the President sends in troops to silence peaceful protestors, as he did outside the White House for a photo op, I see the Castros who routinely use state forces against political dissidents.”  —“U.S. Chamber Of Commerce Endorses Kean For Congress”      A message from Masterworks:      LOCAL    HOW MUCH MORE PPE COULD THE DISTRICT BUY WITH INZELBUCH’S $600K SALARY? — “Lakewood schools: Board lawyer Inzelbuch takes spotlight; teachers chafe over 'dangerous actions,” by The Asbury Park Press’ Gustavo Martinez Contreras: “It's the start of another school year in Lakewood and Michael Inzelbuch is out front again. Literally. The Board of Education attorney was outside the middle school chasing after the teachers' union president as reporters sought to conduct on-camera interviews. When Kimberlee Shaw, Lakewood Education Association president, turned left, so did Inzelbuch. When Shaw turned right, Inzelbuch followed, like a duckling chasing its mother. He butted in again and again, seizing the spotlight. The interviews were a bust. ‘You (Shaw) don't do nothing for Lakewood. Let's meet,’ Inzelbuch interjected. Inzelbuch's outsize role in directing the 6,500-student district has long attracted attention from union leaders, politicians and watchdog groups, but he is even more prominent than usual, with the pandemic swirling in the background and Lakewood attempting to offer what few New Jersey districts are: a nearly normal school experience.”  NEXT YOU’LL TELL ME STUDENTS WHO DON’T GO TO CLASS WON’T PASS — “Paterson schools dock pay of 450 employees in COVID-19 dispute, teacher's union says,” by The Paterson Press’ Joe Malinconico: “About 450 Paterson educators who didn't report to their schools for an in-person class preparation day on Sept. 1 will find their paychecks a little short on Tuesday, according to the city teachers' union. Superintendent Eileen Shafer is carrying out her warning that employees who didn't come to work would be docked for the preparation day, despite the union’s assertions that the district failed to provide sufficient health protection for staffers amid the COVID-19 crisis. The union argued the school lacked proper ventilation and sufficient plexiglass partitions. But the district has maintained that sufficient safeguards were in place.”  TRAIN TO MANASQUAN — “Asbury Park Zombie Walk virtual in 2020, cancels in-person gathering,” by The Asbury Park Press’ Alex Biese: “The Asbury Park Zombie Walk, an annual tradition for more than a decade historically held on the first Saturday of October, will not hold a in-person gather in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, event organizers announced on Monday. 'It seems like the ultimate irony that an actual viral pandemic is keeping our zombies from converging on the Boardwalk this October, but it is with the health and safety of every one of you in mind that we cannot host the Zombie Walk in Asbury Park this year,' event founder Jason Meehan said in a statement Monday morning.”  WHEN THEY DROP THE PRETENSE OF SUPPORTING LEGAL IMMIGRANTS—“Jersey City to join NYC in court fight to oppose increase for immigration fees,” by Hudson County View’s John Heinis: “Jersey City is poised to join New York City in a court fight to oppose immigration fees such as an increase for U.S. citizenship applications, with fees projected to jump from $725 to about $1,200 on this side of the Hudson River, according to Mayor Steven Fulop … On September 2nd, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued a policy alert that indicated they had published a new fee schedule, along with changes to other immigrant benefit requests on August 3rd, and that the new fees would go into effect on October 2nd.”  —“OSHA official, brother, caught on recording after soliciting bribe from North Bergen contractor”  —“NJ teacher files defamation lawsuit over Facebook posts mistaking her identity with child sex offender”  —“Lawsuits accuse Englewood police of harassment, racial bias against non-Black officers”  —“Some N.J. teachers were denied work-from-home requests.

That smashed the previous record of $614 million set in Nevada in Nov. 2019. The extra money helped cushion the blow of months of losses incurred by New Jersey’s casinos and two racetracks that offer sports betting, helping them start to rebound financially.”  —“Amazon hiring 6,900 in New Jersey; here are the kinds of jobs and what they pay”      A message from Masterworks: History shows adding blue-chip art can boost portfolio stability.
