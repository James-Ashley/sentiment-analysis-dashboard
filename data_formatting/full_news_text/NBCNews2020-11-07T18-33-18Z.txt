Desi Twitter erupted Saturday in response to the news that Joe Biden became president-elect and Sen. Kamala Harris will become the first female, first Black and first South Asian American vice president.  Many on Desi Twitter, the space where South Asians share everything from political commentary to inside jokes and memes, celebrated the win for representation.  Leading up to the election, a report found that 65 percent of Indian Americans were planning to vote for Biden. Demographic breakdowns for Asian Americans have not yet been released for this year's election.  Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, had highlighted her roots in her vice presidential acceptance speech in August, acknowledging "my chitthis," the Tamil word for "aunts."  That instance had created an emotional stir for her South Asian supporters. Here's how the community reacted to the news of her election Saturday.

But I did not grow up in a country where it ever seemed possible to be a women of color and a Vice President much less a Black and Indian woman VP. It is hard to put into words what it means to know that the future generations of my family will. — Johana Bhuiyan (@JMBooyah) November 7, 2020  First female VP.    First Black VP.    First South Asian VP.    A daughter of immigrants.    Ladies and Gentlemen, Vice President Kamala Harris.
