New York (CNN Business) Vice Media is once again working to distance itself from its co-founder, Gavin McInnes, who set much of the tone for the company in its early days before going on to found the Proud Boys, the far-right group whose ideology ​has been labeled "misogynistic, Islamophobic, transphobic, and anti-immigration" by the Anti-Defamation League.  Wednesday night, one day after President Donald Trump failed to disavow the Proud Boys during a presidential debate, instead telling them to "stand back and stand by," Vice Media CEO ​Nancy Dubuc sent an email to her staff to reassure them that the media company has no current connection with McInnes.  "I'm sure we're all still trying to make some sense of what was said in last night's U.S. Presidential debate, but I wanted to write to you to make one thing clear: Gavin McInnes has no affiliation with VICE," Dubuc said in her email, which was obtained by CNN Business. "While the legacy of his role in founding the company swirls up from time to time - I want you all to be assured that any association he had with the company ended more than a decade ago in 2008. What he did after that - including founding the Proud Boys in 2016 - had nothing to do with VICE, our values or our people."  The email was first reported by The Wrap.  McInnes may not have any affiliation with Vice Media now. But he did co-found the alternative magazine that grew into what Vice Media is today, and he worked at Vice for 14 years.
