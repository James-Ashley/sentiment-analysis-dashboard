Twitter temporarily suspended an official account of the Hungarian government on Wednesday.  Zoltan Kovacs, Hungary’s Secretary of State for International Communication and Relations, said in a tweet from his own account that the official account of the Hungarian government, @AboutHungary, was suspended by Twitter “without warning or explanation.”  He noted this happened the same day the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, published a report on the state of democracy and the rule of law in all the EU’s 27 countries.  TRUMP TWEETS BIDEN 'LOST' THE 'RADICAL LEFT' OVER DEBATE PERFORMANCE  Kovacs, who frequently defends Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s anti-immigration policies and his “illiberal democracy” in the international media, said, “it seems that the beautiful new world has finally arrived, in which tech giants are silencing those who hold different opinions than loopy liberals.”  He said the Hungarian government has “taken the necessary steps and are awaiting an official explanation from Twitter.”  HUNGARY'S ORBAN CITES 'FAKE NEWS' ABOUT CORONAVIRUS FOR DETENTIONS  After the account was reactivated, @AboutHungary confirmed: “This account was indeed suspended without warning or explanation. It has apparently now been restored -- also without explanation.”  Another Twitter account, @RMXnews, which belongs to a government-supported media publication, was also suspended with the same notice and had yet to be restored.
