Attendees of a recent beer fest in North Carolina should consider getting tested for COVID-19 after at least two coronavirus cases were connected to the event, according to a local report.  Those who attended "Mecktoberfest" at the Olde Mecklenburg Brewery in Charlotte from Sept. 25 to 27 may have been exposed to the virus, Mecklenburg County Public Health Director Gibbie Harris told county commissioners on Tuesday, the Charlotte Observer reported.  The event, Harris said, involved “very few masks” and “very little social distancing.”  “There were thousands of people there. Those folks need to be tested,” Harris said, according to the newspaper.
