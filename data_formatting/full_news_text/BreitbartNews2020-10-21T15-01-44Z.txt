Anti-law enforcement protesters continued their attack on federal agents at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland, Oregon. Protesters threw bottles, rocks, and other projectiles at federal agents and called them “Nazi terrorists.”  In one video tweeted by journalist Andy Ngo, protesters can be heard screaming, “You’re a f-cking Nazi, you piece of sh-t.” Later, someone in the crowd throws a glass bottle at the agents, Ngo reported.  “You’re a f—ing Nazi terrorist!” #Antifa rioters confront federal officers tonight in Portland outside the @ICEgov building.
