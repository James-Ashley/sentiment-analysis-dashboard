(CNN) The Trump administration is considering putting up billboards of immigration violators, an unprecedented move in lockstep with the President's law-and-order message ahead of the election, according to two sources familiar with the proposal.  President Donald Trump has repeatedly gone after so-called "sanctuary cities" -- cities that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities -- arguing that they put public safety at risk.  The billboards would be put up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- the enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security -- in at least one city and would call attention to immigrants who have committed crimes and been released by local authorities. It's unclear what the billboards will look like and at what cost. If the plan proceeds, it seems intended to single out sanctuary jurisdictions and stoke fear within those communities.  The Department of Homeland Security, along with the Justice Department, have been criticized for efforts that look political to boost Trump amid a contentious election season.  Most recently, the two federal departments came under increased scrutiny for admonishing Portland, Oregon, where protests at times turned violent. DOJ also recently singled out three major Democratic-led cities -- Portland, New York City, and Seattle -- as having "permitted violence and destruction of property."
