New York (CNN Business) The multibillion dollar "Star Wars" franchise is getting a new video game that takes players to the skies. Inspired by the '90s Star Wars flight games, "Star Wars: Squadrons" came out Friday, and its main draw is letting fans pilot their own spaceships, zooming past debris and space rocks to fire down enemy targets.  Electronic Arts' Motive Studios made the game, which was licensed by Disney . And compared with some of EA's other popular titles, like the "FIFA" franchise, "Squadrons" is a relatively small game â€” it doesn't come with a bunch of extra features, nor does it encourage users to make additional software purchases. It's also priced lower, at $40 compared with $60 to $70 for typical EA games.  "Squadrons" focuses on the pilot fantasy element of the "Star Wars" franchise for the bulk of its game, which takes place after the events of "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi." CNN Business got to try it out. In the game's main campaign, you alternate between helping the Empire and the opposing side, the New Republic. You take missions like protecting refugees and finding missing scouts.  Each starfighter you pilot has lasers and shields, and you can also aim missiles at your targets. The controls involve spinning your starfighter rapidly in outer space, weaving and dodging incoming attacks.  The game also has a multiplayer mode including dogfights and fleet battles, and it supports virtual reality for a more immersive experience. It's available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. Console and PC players can game together.  Read More 'Star Wars: Squadrons' lets players pilot their own starfighters
