U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested multiple Antifa protesters after they allegedly vandalized the Portland, Oregon, ICE facility. The building has been a favorite site for direct actions in recent months.  Agents with Homeland Security Investigations rushed out of the ICE facility in Portland to chase down a group of protesters who allegedly spray-painted on the building Sunday night, according to a tweet by Independent Media PDX. Agents arrested six or seven people based upon different media account tweets.  One tweet shows the vandalized building and a U.S. flag burning.  After multiple arrests were made, Portland protesters set fire to an American flag in front of the SW Portland ICE Building. #Portland #protest #Portlandprotest #ICE pic.twitter.com/JCyYtHlng6 — Independent Media PDX (@NDpendentPDX) December 7, 2020  A tweet by freelance journalist Justin Yau shows a group of Antifa wearing black bloc outside the ICE facility.
