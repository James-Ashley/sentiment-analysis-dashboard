Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is proposing increasing how many immigrants Canada brings in each year, but a new poll suggests that it’s out of step with what Canadians want.  A Nanos Research Group poll, reported by Bloomberg News, found that only 17% of respondents think the country should accept more immigrants in 2021 than it did in 2020. Of the rest, 40 percent want the same amount and 36 percent want fewer immigrants.

In part because of coronavirus restrictions, Canada only added 128,425 people in 2020, lower than its 341,000 target. Mendicino told Reuters that immigration is “one of the keys to our economic recovery and our long-term prosperity.”  But the opposition Conservative Party lawmakers opposed the push by Trudeau’s Liberal Party, saying that an economic downturn with high unemployment was not a time to be bringing in more workers.
