WASHINGTON ó The presidential transition is now underway, and the 2020 election is finally in the rearview mirror.  But it wasnít easy.  Yes, the General Services Administrationís Emily Murphy ascertained Joe Bidenís apparent victory, opening up resources for the transition, but it took more than two weeks to get there.  Yes, Michigan certified its vote totals, but one Republican member of the state canvassing board still abstained, despite Biden winning the state by more than 150,000 votes.  Yes, Pennsylvania is on its way to certification, too, even as a few Republicans from key counties voted against certification (see here and here).  And, yes, just enough Republicans spoke up against President Trumpís attempts to overturn the election results or prevent the transition, but others stayed silent ñ or even supported the presidentís efforts.  ìGOP Sens/Reps were allowed to stay silent on the GSA thanks to the local GOP officials (GA Sec/State, Maricopa Cty Board Chair etc.) & the fed/state judges who provided the necessary legal guardrails to prevent things from getting to a constitutional crisis level,î the Cook Political Reportís Amy Walter tweeted.  The U.S. democracy hung on ó by just enough.  And it all raises the question what could have happened if the 2020 presidential outcome was actually closer than it turned out to be.  This is what a third Obama term would have looked like  Last winter and spring, most Democratic primary voters chose restoration over revolution and big structural change, and thatís what theyíre getting with Joe Bidenís cabinet picks ó folks who could/would have been members of a potential third Obama term.  Tony Blinken, Bidenís selection for secretary of state, just happened to be deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration.  Alejandro Mayorkas, the pick to head the Department of Homeland Security, was Obamaís deputy DHS secretary.  You have Janet Yellen (Obamaís Fed chair) at Treasury, and John Kerry (Obamaís second-term secretary of state) as Bidenís selection to be climate envoy.  Of course, all of these selections have Bidenís imprint on them.  And the picks make some history. If confirmed, Mayorkas would be the first Latino to head DHS; Yellen would be the first woman to lead the Treasury Department; and Haines would be the first woman to serve as DNI.  Biden is expected to appear with his cabinet nominees and appointees today in Wilmington, Del.
