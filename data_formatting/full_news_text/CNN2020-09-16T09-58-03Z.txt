(CNN) Germany will take more than 1,500 migrants currently sheltering on Greek islands, Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesperson Steffen Seibert announced Tuesday.  The country's decision comes after a major fire wrecked a migrant camp on the Greek island of Lesbos.  A statement from Seibert says that 1,553 people from 408 families who have already secured refugee status will be taken in.  In addition, the German government is "committed to a further European solution with other welcoming member states," he said.  In the context of such a European solution, Germany will also participate "to make an additional effort in line with the size of our country," the statement said.
