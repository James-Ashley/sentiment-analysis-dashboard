With Democrats widely expected to keep control, the question is: how many seats do they gain or lose this year?  Democrats will defend their majority in the US House of Representatives in the November 3 election, in which about one in 10 of the chamber’s 435 seats will be the subject of a competitive race, according to nonpartisan tracking services.  Political analysts agree that the Democrats’ control of the House is almost certainly safe. Republicans would need a net gain of 21 seats to regain the majority. Considering the math regarding the number of competitive Democratic-held seats, flipping the House is likely out of reach for the GOP this year.  The questions that will be answered on Election Day: Will Republicans gain ground or will Democrats expand their majority?
