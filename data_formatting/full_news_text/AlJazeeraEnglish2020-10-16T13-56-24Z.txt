Friday, October 16:  20:35 ET – More than 22 million voters cast ballots already: AP  More than 22 million US voters have cast their ballots already in the US presidential election, the Associated Press news agency has reported.  That corresponds to 16 percent of all the votes that were cast in 2016, the news agency said.  The high early turnout – propelled partly by the COVID-19 pandemic – is leading election experts to predict that a record 150 million votes may be cast this year and turnout rates could be higher than in any US presidential election since 1908.  19:45 ET – Trump touts ‘economic success’ in Georgia rally  Speaking at a campaign rally in Macon, Georgia, Trump said “we have the most successful economy” in the world.  “Our economy is setting records,” he told the crowd.  “I would never give up what we have achieved.

During a campaign stop in Detroit, Michigan, Biden also urged people to cast their ballots in the tightly-contested election.  “We’ll always have your back, I promise you,” Biden said. “Don’t let anyone discourage you and tell you your vote doesn’t count, because it does.”  In case you missed it: Donald Trump defended his handling of the COVID crisis that has killed more than 216,000 Americans and declined to denounce QAnon.

Grateful for his quick response,” Newsom said in a brief statement.  Neither he nor the White House gave details on why the administration shifted positions only hours after it initially denied the state’s request for a declaration that officials said could provide the state with hundreds of millions of dollars.  Federal major disaster declarations allow for cost-sharing for damage, clean-up and rebuilding between the state and federal governments [Gene Blevins/Reuters]  18:20 ET – Biden calls Trump silence on white supremacists ‘stunning’  Joe Biden has described Trump’s reluctance to denounce white supremacists as “stunning” in a hard-hitting speech in battleground state of Michigan with 18 days to go until the election.  Standing by the side of the Democratic presidential candidate as he spoke was Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a fierce Trump critic who was recently found to be the target of a well-planned kidnapping plot by a heavily armed right-wing group.  “Make no mistake, that’s who they are, domestic terrorists,” Biden told a group of some 20 guests and reporters in the town of Southfield.  “The failure to condemn these folks is stunning.”  18:00 ET – Georgia vote count surpasses 1 million  More than one million people have already cast their ballots in the US state of Georgia.  Early polling began on October 12 in the state that has historically voted Republican and it will run until October 30.

Most polls show a close race in the important battleground state that both the Republican incumbent and Democrat Joe Biden are courting heavily.  “Addressing a campaign rally Friday in Ocala, a city in central Florida, Trump reminded thousands of supporters that “I live here, too.” He recently switched his legal residence from New York.  He said in 18 days “we’re going to win the state of Florida. We’re going to win the White House.” Trump won Florida in 2016.

Compromise is not a dirty word. I’m running as a proud Democrat but I’m going to govern as an American president. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as hose who do.”  Biden speaks at Beech Woods Recreation Center, in Southfield, Michigan [Carolyn Kaster/AP]  15:30 ET – US surpasses eight million COVID-19 cases: Johns Hopkins  The US has recorded more than eight million cases of COVID-19, Johns Hopkins University said, a grim milestone that comes a little more than two weeks before the presidential election on November 3.

The web of convoluted conspiracies known as QAnon, which began in 2017 when a shadowy figure known as Q began posting fringe ideas and breadcrumb narratives on sites like 4chan, has gone increasingly viral, although its support offline has been harder to quantify. Researchers say it remains relatively small.

Local media reported that more than 90 percent of those applications, or about 336,000, were denied as duplicates, primarily because people who had requested mail-in ballots for the state’s June 2 primary did not realise that they had checked a box to be sent ballots for the general election, too.  Voters have also been baffled by unclear or inaccurate information on the state’s ballot-tracking website, and by a wave of mail ballot applications from political parties and get-out-the-vote groups.  County offices across the state have been forced to hire temporary staff and work seven days a week to cope with the confusion.  12:20 ET – ‘Hamilton’ cast to host a virtual fundraiser for Biden campaign  Biden’s presidential campaign announced that it will be holding a virtual grassroots fundraiser with the cast of the hit musical Hamilton on Friday night.

This includes his really bad interview last night. Why is Twitter doing this. Bringing more attention to Sleepy Joe & Big T.”  Twitter Shuts Down Entire Network To Slow Spread Of Negative Biden News https://t.co/JPmjOrKPcr via @TheBabylonBee Wow, this has never been done in history. This includes his really bad interview last night. Why is Twitter doing this. Bringing more attention to Sleepy Joe & Big T — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2020  Twitter, did not shut down, as the article was written by the satire news site, Babylon Bee.  The Tweet also caused Big T and Babylon Bee to trend on the site. Some users thought “Big T” was a reference to “Trump”. But Trump later clarified that Big T was a reference to Big Tech.  Big T was not a reference to me, but rather to Big Tech, which should have been properly pointed out in Twitter’s Fake Trending Section! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2020  11:15 ET – Rapper launches Black party  Rapper Diddy, born Sean Combs, via a series of Tweets has announced that he is launching a Black political party, named Our Black Party, calling it the “boldest thing” he has ever done.  The party’s website lists nine core values that lay out the rights of Black people in America.  So, I'm launching one of the boldest things I've ever launched. I'm launching a Black political party with some young Black elected officials and activists. It's called @OurBlackParty, it doesn't matter if you are Republican or Democrat… — Diddy (@Diddy) October 16, 2020  And with early voting already under way across the country, the party says it is aimed at “getting Trump out of office”.  “This man literally threatened the lives of us and our families,” he said in a video.  In another Tweet, Combs said, “we need to get Biden in and hold him accountable”.  This man literally threatened the lives of us & our families.

Hogan said Reagan is his “hero in politics” and he made the decision after concluding that he could support neither Trump nor Biden.  “I know it’s simply symbolic. It’s not going to change the outcome in my state. But I thought it was important to just cast a vote that showed the kind of person I’d like to see in office,” Hogan said in an interview with the Washington Post.  10:30 ET – Christie says he was wrong not to wear mask in White House  Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said he was wrong not to wear a mask at the White House after he and Trump both contracted the coronavirus.  In a statement, Christie said he has recovered from COVID-19 after a week-long stay in a hospital’s intensive care unit. He called on all political leaders to advocate for face coverings, with the practice becoming increasingly politicised even as the pandemic has killed more than 218,000 Americans.  “I believed that when I entered the White House grounds, that I had entered a safe zone, due to the testing that and I and many others underwent every day,” Christie said. “I was wrong.”  FILE PHOTO: US President-elect Donald Trump stands with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie before their meeting at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, US, November 20, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo  10:20 ET – Nebraska Senator rips into Trump over COVID-19, foreign policy  Ben Sasse, a Republican US senator, told Nebraska constituents in a telephone town hall meeting that Trump has “flirted with white supremacists,” mocks Christian evangelicals in private, and “kisses dictators’ butts”.  Sasse, who is running for a second term representing a reliably Republican state, made the comments in response to a question about why he has been willing to publicly criticise a president of his own party.  He also criticised Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and said Trump’s family has treated the presidency “like a business opportunity”.  10:00 ET – It has been one year since Trump and Pelosi have spoken  An emblem of political polarisation in Washington: Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have not spoken directly since October 16, 2019 – exactly one year ago.  On that date, Pelosi and other Democratic leaders walked out of a meeting at the White House about Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria. As tensions rose, Trump called Pelosi a “third-rate politician” and shortly thereafter, the Democratic leaders left the meeting.  Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her “upstairs,” or she just plain doesn’t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2019  Pelosi this week said any negotiations she has with the White House are through Trump’s intermediaries, not with Trump himself.  09:45 ET – White House was warned Russia targeted Giuliani as misinformation messenger: Report  The Washington Post is reporting the White House was warned last year that Trump’s lawyer and adviser, Rudy Giuliani, was the target of a Russian intelligence disinformation operation.  The warnings led National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien to alert Trump that any information Giuliani brought back from his trips to Ukraine – including information about Joe Biden’s son Hunter’s business dealings – should be considered as having Russia’s fingerprints on it. Trump reportedly “shrugged his shoulders” and dismissed the concerns.  Giuliani is reportedly one of the sources of a disputed New York Post report that was published this week about Hunter Biden’s dealings in Ukraine.  Trump reportedly was warned about info Rudy Giuliani gathered in Ukraine [File: Sarah Silbiger/Reuters]  09:30 ET – Biden significantly outraises Trump in September  Joe Biden and the Democrats have announced their record-breaking September fundraising haul: $383m, and it was suspected this would put him far ahead of Trump’s campaign. Now we know how much further ahead Biden is.  Trump’s campaign and Republicans raised $247.5m in September and ended the month with $251.4m cash on hand. Biden’s campaign announced having $432m in the bank as of September 30.  The campaigns will have one final pre-election fundraising disclosure next week which will give a snapshot of how much they have on hand as of October 14.  09:15 ET – Trump’s smile and Mister Rogers  Two moments from last night’s duelling Trump-Biden town halls touched on one unlikely subject: Smiles.  Before asking a question about immigration, a voter said to Trump: “I have to say, you have a great smile … You’re so handsome when you smile,” prompting a wide grin from the president.  Voter to President Trump at #TrumpTownHall: “You’re so handsome when you smile." pic.twitter.com/KgJThAtAQg — NBC News (@NBCNews) October 16, 2020  Interestingly, after the town hall, the Miami New Times caught up with that voter, Paulette Dale, who told the newspaper that she is voting for Biden. “I wish he would smile more and talk less,” she said about Trump.  As for Biden, the Trump campaign senior adviser, Mercedes Schlapp, was growing frustrated with the tone of the Biden town hall and compared it with “watching an episode of” Mister Rogers Neighborhood. She was referring to Fred Rogers, the late children’s television show host who continues to bring smiles to the faces of children and adults and is lauded for his kindness and patience.  Well @JoeBiden @ABCPolitics townhall feels like I am watching an episode of Mister Rodgers Neighborhood. https://t.co/bC8fIZPxHR — Mercedes Schlapp (@mercedesschlapp) October 16, 2020  Her remarks caused Mister Rogers to trend on Twitter with many responses finding humour in Schlapp’s attempt at an insult turning into an inadvertent compliment of Biden.  So you are saying Biden was great? Because most Americans would prefer mr Rogers at this point — Matthew Dowd (@matthewjdowd) October 16, 2020  09:00 ET – Twenty-one million Americans have already voted  Turnout totals for early voting – expanded across the US due to the pandemic – has shot past 21 million, far outpacing this point in previous elections.  The US Elections Project, which tracks early voting across the country, has reported that 21,231,821 people have already voted ahead of Election Day, November 3. In 2016, the total number of Americans who voted early by mail or in-person early voting was 47 million.  Early voters wait to cast their ballots at the South Regional Library polling location in Durham, North Carolina, October 15, 2020 [Gerry Broome/AP] More Democrats than Republicans have cast their ballots so far, however, election experts caution that it is unknown exactly who those voters voted for until those votes are counted. In addition, Republicans historically have participated less in early voting and traditionally turn out in larger numbers in person on Election Day.
