Washington (CNN) The White House is showing no signs of backing down from President Donald Trump's refusal to condemn White supremacy during Tuesday night's presidential debate, despite pleas from some Republican allies to clarify his comments.  White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Thursday would not give a declarative statement denouncing White supremacy, instead pointing to the President's past comments and insisting that he did not misspeak during the debate or after.  "The President, specifically, verbatim, was asked (Wednesday): 'White supremacy -- do you denounce them?' To which he responded, 'I have always denounced any form of that,' " McEnany said. "Those are the facts."  But McEnany excluded the fact that when Trump was asked if he condemned White supremacists on Wednesday, he appeared to equate violence by far-left groups with White supremacy.  Asked if he condemned White supremacists, Trump told reporters: "I've always denounced any form, any form of any of that. You have to denounce. But I also -- Joe Biden has to say something about antifa."  Read More White House shows no signs of backing down from Trump's refusal to condemn White supremacy
