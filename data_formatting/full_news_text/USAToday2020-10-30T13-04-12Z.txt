New Yorkers who have voted early to those who haven't yet: Bring a chair and hope for cookies from Paul Rudd.  Ever since early voting started, New Yorkers have stood in lengthy lines, with some waiting hours to cast their ballot in person. Why? USA TODAY's New York state team offers some answers: A relative lack of polling places in some areas of the state, enhanced cleaning protocols in the COVID-19 era and a turnout that appears to have caught some officials off guard. On the last weekend of early voting, we're guessing many will be in Halloween costumes.  For the first time this year, all New York voters had three options to cast a ballot: Early voting, traditional Election Day voting and, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, absentee voting.  Some context: Election-reform advocates say what's happening in New York is evidence of an energized presidential electorate eager to participate in early voting, which lawmakers and Gov. Andrew Cuomo first adopted last year after dozens of other states had already done so. It's also laid bare the system's growing pains. Read more.  More news to keep in mind today: We're just four days away from Election Day, and USA TODAY is keeping track of what's happening as voters around the country cast ballots.

Know your voting rights: If you encounter intimidation at the polls on Election Day, here's what to do.  Legal battles are happening on a massive scale: A record-setting number of lawsuits have been filed this year, with even more likely after the polls close. More than 230 election-related federal lawsuits were filed from Jan. 1 to Oct. 23, higher than any of the past three presidential election years during the same time period, a USA TODAY analysis of federal court data found.

"I decided this time that I wanted the right man in there."  Early votes in Texas surpass total cast in 2016 with Election Day still to go  Early voting has surged to unprecedented levels in the 2020 election, especially in Texas where the number of early votes has already surpassed the total number of ballots cast four years ago.  According to the Texas Secretary of State office, 8,969,226 out of 15,101,087 registered voters cast ballots in the entire 2016 general election. The official vote count in Texas through Thursday is already at 9,009,850 ‚Äì with a full day of early voting and Election Day left to go.  Voters in Texas do not register by party, so the early returns don't indicate whether the high numbers favor either Democrats or Republicans. Polling indicates a very tight race in the Lone Star State, which Trump won four years ago by nine percentage points.  ‚Äì William Cummings  Florida early voting site closes because of COVID-19 among election workers  A Palm Bay, Florida, early voting site has been closed after election workers there tested positive for COVID-19, Brevard County Supervisor of Elections Lori Scott announced Friday.  The affected site is at the supervisor of elections' Palm Bay administrative offices, 450 Cogan Drive SE, which also is temporarily closed.  Citing the "stringent safety protocols" in place since the since the March presidential preference primary, Scott said: "It is a tribute to our strict safety measures that we have been able to process almost a half a million voters through the election process this year before having our first positive case.‚Äù  Early in-person voting continues from 8 am. to 6 p.m. Friday and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and voters were urged to visit other early voting sites in the area.

Groups including the Georgia NAACP and Fair Fight Action called on Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to use emergency powers to order voting be extended through 9 p.m. Friday in affected areas. Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger said that 15 counties were affected. Friday is Georgia‚Äôs last day of early in-person voting.  Voting was disrupted at some sites in metro Atlanta and north Georgia after the storm caused power outages. Several polling places opened late.  ‚Äì Associated Press  Will the weather impact turnout? Turns out, it should be a nice day  The weather on Election Day itself could be less important this year than it has been in past presidential elections because of the surge in early voting. In any case, most of the nation should be seeing mild temperatures. Warmer-than-normal conditions are expected for the western two-thirds of the U.S.  ‚ÄúWe know from polling that weather can have a major impact on voter turnout, and that bad weather impacts Democratic voters‚Äô ability to reach the polling sites more than Republican voters," said Paul Walsh of the Weather Company, in an e-mail to USA TODAY.  "Of course this is 2020 and anything can happen, but the forecast is calling for most of the country to have relatively dry and seasonal weather conditions, which provides yet another tailwind for high turnout," Walsh said.  ‚Äì Doyle Rice  New citizens in Massachusetts given bad info on their voting eligibility, report says  Federal immigration officials incorrectly told more than 400 new U.S. citizens in Massachusetts that they couldn‚Äôt vote in this year‚Äôs general election because the state‚Äôs registration deadline had passed before they took their citizenship oaths, according to a published report.  Denis Riordan, director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Boston, acknowledged the error in a statement to GBH News.  Some agency officials presiding over naturalization ceremonies Monday and Tuesday informed newly sworn-in citizens that Massachusetts‚Äô Oct. 24 voter registration deadline had already passed, so they would not be able to vote, he said. The agency has since confirmed that in Massachusetts, residents naturalized after that deadline may still register to vote up until 4 p.m. on Nov. 2.  ‚Äì Associated Press  Many in jail are eligible to vote. But casting a ballot behind bars isn't easy  Some hundreds of thousands of people are in local jails around the country, the majority of whom retain their voting eligibility as they await trial or serve misdemeanor sentences. Yet many face "de facto disenfranchisement" by structural barriers that prevent their access to voting information, registration materials and absentee ballot applications, legal experts and advocates say.  Although a smaller group than those disenfranchised by felony convictions, people in jails encounter hurdles to access voting than most other voters never face. Voters in jail often rely on outside civic groups to register them, and many of those initiatives were limited this year due to the coronavirus: "COVID has exacerbated all the existing barriers that make voting from jails difficult," said Dana Paikowsky, a legal fellow at the Campaign Legal Center who focuses on access to voting in jails.

That fear is felt across much of the country. Three-quarters of voters say they're concerned about the possibility of violence, while only 1 in 4 say they're "very confident" the country will see a peaceful transfer of power if Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden defeats President Donald Trump, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll finds.  -- Kristine Phillips, Kevin Johnson and Grace Hauck  Paul Rudd treats drenched New York voters to cookies as long lines plague state  Some New Yorkers got a sweet surprise from Paul Rudd on Thursday, as they braved the rain to vote early in the 2020 election. According to videos and pictures circulating on Twitter, the beloved (and ageless) actor handed out cookies to people waiting in the rain to vote at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

"I wanted to say thank you, for coming out and voting and doing your part," Rudd says in the video, as he hands a voter a cookie.

Hail to you, determined voters  Walmart removes guns, ammo from displays amid concerns of civil unrest  Walmart has pulled guns and ammunition from its sales floors ahead of the election, company officials confirmed to USA TODAY.  The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which said the retailer was looking to head off any potential theft of firearms if stores are broken into amid any civil unrest caused by the upcoming presidential election on Tuesday.  "We have seen some isolated civil unrest and as we have done on several occasions over the last few years, we have moved our firearms and ammunition off the sales floor as a precaution for the safety of our associates and customers," Walmart said in a statement to USA TODAY.

State vote certification deadlines differ and don't have to be reported to the federal level until Dec. 8. Additionally, the Electoral College doesn‚Äôt meet until Dec. 14.  Texas judge overrules governor, voids mask exception at polling places  A federal judge in San Antonio has voided Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's exception to statewide mask mandates and ruled that everyone who enters or works at a polling place in the state must wear a face covering.  U.S. District Judge Jason Pulliam, appointed by President Donald Trump, said the exemption for polling sites violates the Voting Rights Act ‚Äúbecause it creates a discriminatory burden on Black and Latino voters.‚Äù  The pandemic has disproportionately affected minorities, placing them at higher risk of severe illness and death and forcing them to make ‚Äúthe unfortunate choice required between voting and minimizing their risk‚Äù of exposure under Abbott‚Äôs poll exemption, the judge wrote. ‚ÄúThis discriminatory effect can be eliminated, or at least mitigated, if all people wear masks at polling sites.‚Äù  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said he will ask the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to block the order.  ‚Äì Chuck Lindell, Austin American-Statesman  Worried about voter suppression? Call an election hotline run by lawyers for help  Nearly 24,000 lawyers are volunteering to help voters across the country navigate changes in what has become an unprecedented election cycle. Organizers of Election Protection, a national coalition of civil rights and voting rights groups, said the number of volunteers has quadrupled since the 2016 presidential election and the 2018 midterm elections. They‚Äôre bracing for even more calls as Election Day nears and in the days and weeks following.  The Election Protection hotline (866-OUR-VOTE) is available all year, but calls have ramped up in recent weeks as millions started casting ballots early in some states. The hotline has received more than 100,000 calls since July, averaging about 7,000 a day, organizers said. At this point in 2016, the group had fielded 21,000 calls since January of that year.  ‚Äì Deborah Barfield Berry Voting 2020 live updates: Long lines plague New York; Election Day forecast shows good weather across US; Zeta impacts Georgia polls
