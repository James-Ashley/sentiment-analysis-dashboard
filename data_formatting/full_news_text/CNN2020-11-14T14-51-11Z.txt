Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (CNN) Two airports in Ethiopia's Amhara state which neighbors Tigray -- where federal troops are fighting local forces -- were targeted by rocket fire late on Friday, the government said, as an 11-day conflict widened.  The airport in Gondar in Amhara state, which neighbors Tigray, was hit on Friday, while another rocket aimed at the Bahir Dar airport missed the target, the government said.  The ruling Tigray party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), said the Tigray Defence Forces conducted missile strikes in military bases in Bahir Dar and Gondar in retaliation for air strikes conducted by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's forces in various parts of the state.  "As long as the attacks on the people of Tigray do not stop, the attacks will intensify," Getachew Reda, a spokesperson for the TPLF, said in a statement on the Facebook page of the Tigray state's communications office.  Abiy sent the national defense force on an offensive against local troops in Tigray last week, after accusing them of attacking federal troops. Hundreds of people have been killed.
