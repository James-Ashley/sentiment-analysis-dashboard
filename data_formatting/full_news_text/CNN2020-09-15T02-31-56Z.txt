(CNN) A federal judge in Maryland has ruled that Chad Wolf is likely unlawfully serving as acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and temporarily barred the Trump administration from enforcing new asylum restrictions on members of two immigration advocacy groups.  Judge Paula Xinis, in a 69-page ruling issued Friday, wrote that the two groups are "likely to demonstrate (former acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin) McAleenan's appointment was invalid under the agency's applicable order of succession, and so he lacked the authority to amend the order of succession to ensure Wolf's installation as Acting Secretary."  Subsequently, Wolf didn't have the authority to impose the asylum rules that are being challenged, Xinis ruled. The new requirements, which court documents say took effect in late August, concern employment, and the case is ongoing.  Xinis' ruling does not mean Wolf is leaving his position. The appointments of Wolf and his No. 2, Ken Cuccinelli, to the top leadership roles in the Department of Homeland Security have increasingly come under scrutiny, though both continue to serve in their posts. The Trump administration appealed a federal judge's ruling earlier this year that it was unlawful to appoint Cuccinelli to lead the agency responsible for processing US immigration requests, and he remains in that post more than six months later. The case before Xinis is ongoing.  CNN has reached out to the department for comment.
