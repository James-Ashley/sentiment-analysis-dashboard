The campaign alleges “voters being held to different standards depending on how they chose to exercise their right to vote.” They say in-person voters and their votes were under more scrutiny than mail-in votes and argued this violates the US Constitution.  The lawsuit was filed today in a Pennsylvania federal court. Ostensibly the Trump camp hopes this will make its way to the US Supreme Court.  9 Nov 2020 - 21:57 GMT  Trump spokeswoman continues to allege voting irregularities, says election not over  White House press secretary Kaleigh McEnany said at a press conference with Republican Party chair Ronna McDaniel that the election remains in question because of favouritism in Pennsylvania.  “Our position is clear. We want to protect the franchise of the American people. We want an honest, accurate, lawful count,” McEnany said. “What we have seen across the country is Democrat officials systematically trying to do an end run around the Constitution to tip the scales of the election in their favour.”  A Trump campaign lawyer said more than 600,000 ballots were counted outside the view of campaign observers. Trump’s campaign has continually alleged widespread fraud, although have not, to date, offered evidence.  9 Nov 2020 - 21:18 GMT  Top Senate Democrat Schumer says Biden will be president  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Joe Biden won the election and will be the next president.  “The country will finally turn the page on one of the most divisive and chaotic chapters in our history,” Schumer said in remarks to the Senate.  “It is time to come together and heal, to unify once again, to fight not our political opponents but our common enemies, disease and poverty and injustice,” Schumer said. “The American people voted to place their faith in President-elect Biden to confront those challenges.”  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said Biden will be president [Alex Edelman/EPA]  9 Nov 2020 - 21:01 GMT  McConnell says Trump within rights to challenge election results  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in his first public remarks since the election that Trump has a right to pursue legal challenges to the outcome.  Trump lost the popular vote nationally and lost in the Electoral College based on preliminary results.  “Obviously, no states have yet certified their election results. We have at least one or two states that are already on track for a recount,” McConnell said in remarks to the Senate which is reconvening in a lame-duck session.  “The core principle here is not complicated. In the United States of America, all legal ballots must be counted and all illegal allots must not be counted. The process should be transparent and observable, and the courts are here to work through concerns,” he said.

Lang Holland, the police chief in Marshall, a small city located about 100 miles (180 kilometers) north of the state’s capital Little Rock, vented his anger at Biden’s victory on Parler, a right-wing social media site.  “Never let them forget they are traitors and have no right to live in this Republic after what they have done,” read a screenshot of one of his posts which were no longer visible on Monday. “Death to all Marxist Democrats,” another post said. “Take no prisoners leave no survivors!!”  Holland resigned at the weekend following outrage over his posts from local residents and beyond. “The Marshall community does not in any way support or condone bullying or threats of violence to anyone of any political persuasion,” the local mayor, Kevin Elliot, said in a statement. “We are a welcoming community that is humbly working to build a bright future for ALL our citizens.”  STATEMENT FROM MARSHALL, AR MAYOR KEVIN ELLIOTT: Officer Lang Holland has reigned from the Marshall Police Department @KATVNews #ARnews (Captured from Marshall, Arkansas Facebook page) pic.twitter.com/zUJCvPOnog — Viktoria Capek (@KATVViktoria) November 7, 2020  9 Nov 2020 - 20:23 GMT  Trump supporters keep vigil outside Philadelphia convention centre  Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont sent this update from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Asa larger Trump rally gathered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a group of six Trump supporters kept vigil outside the convention centre in downtown Philadelphia under a giant American flag and a line of blue Donald Trump campaign flags.  Chris Schneider, who took a bus from Brooklyn, New York, to Philadelphia to attend the protest, said he was “puzzled” by the election results.  “How did Mr Biden and his team have such a big bump that happened after the polls closed?” he asked.”It’s puzzling. I don’t want to think that funny business happened, that’s why I’m here, I want to hear it right from the horse’s mouth. If Giuliani says that there was something going on, he’s my former mayor, and if Mr Giuliani believes that there’s credible evidence then I’m definitely going to listen to him.”  Schneider said Giuliani had raised claims about dead people voting. At a press conference on Saturday, the Trump campaign pointed to a single case of a deceased woman who had voted and died before the election – however, she may have voted early.  The Trump campaign has not yet filed evidence in court regarding the claim. Giuliani said he would file a lawsuit in federal court Monday. As of 14:40 ET (19:40 GMT) on Monday, he had filed no new cases. “If Trump lost fair and square, that’s fine, I accept that result,” Schneider said. “If not, we have another big issue to deal with.”  Brooklyn Trump supporter Chris Schneider, left, and Philadelphia Trump supporter Richard Genevie [Hilary Beaumont/Al Jazeera]  9 Nov 2020 - 20:02 GMT  Trump campaign adviser leading legal challenges has coronavirus  David Bossie, Trump’s campaign advisor who is leading a raft of legal challenges to state election results, has contracted COVID-19, a reporter for Bloomberg has tweeted, citing sources.

Bolsonaro, a far-right politician sometimes called the “Tropical Trump”, is among the few world leaders not to congratulate Biden after he was declared the winner of last week’s election – a fact that has drawn criticism from the Brazilian leader’s opponents.  Referring to Trump’s accusations that the vote was marred by widespread “fraud,” Brazilian Vice President Hamilton Mourao said Bolsonaro was waiting for those allegations to be resolved.  “I believe the president is waiting for the end of that whole mess, the argument over whether there were fake votes or not, before he comments,” said Mourao. “Clearly, when the time is right, he will send Brazil’s congratulations to whomever is elected.” Biden launches coronavirus task force: Live news
