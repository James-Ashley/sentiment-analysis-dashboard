An unlawful assembly was declared in Portland on Tuesday night as protesters clashed with federal officers in front of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building in the city.  Between 50 to 100 demonstrators marched from Elizabeth Caruthers Park before arriving at the building around 10 p.m. An unlawful assembly order was declared soon after, and those in the area were given two minutes to leave.  Members of the group formed an umbrella wall before they moved closer to the building and the federal agents located behind the facility's garage doors, reports said. Some of the protesters reportedly threw objects over the buildingâ€™s fence.

At least one protester appeared to throw an object that landed near the officers. Those at the scene tweeted that tear gas was used.
