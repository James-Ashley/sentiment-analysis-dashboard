(CNN) The Trump administration awarded grants totaling $58 million to two companies with checkered records to care for unaccompanied migrant children, according to a newly-released Senate report, which concluded that the department's failures could have endangered children.  The findings from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations are the latest in a string of reports concerning the care of unaccompanied migrant children, who, after being apprehended at the border, are transferred to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services.  The bipartisan report details grants from HHS to two companies -- VisionQuest National, Ltd. and New Horizon Group Home, LLC -- despite their previous issues over inadequate care.  "HHS did not require either company to disclose prior adverse actions their respective state and local governments had taken against them, and the Department did not research the disciplinary history of either company," Tuesday's 59-page report states, adding that the oversights could've put children "trusted to the care of these companies" at risk.  CNN reached out to HHS, VisionQuest, and New Horizon for comment.  Read More Trump administration awarded millions to companies with checkered records to care for migrant children
