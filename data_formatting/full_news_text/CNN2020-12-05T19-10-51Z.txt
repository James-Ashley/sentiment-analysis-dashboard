(CNN) The end of President Donald Trump's time in office has been marked by a renewed interest in granting clemency -- both from the President, and from members of his inner circle looking for protection before President-elect Joe Biden assumes office.  While Trump has continued to falsely insist publicly that he won the presidential election rather than Biden, the President's pardon of former national security adviser Michael Flynn is a sign Trump understands his time in office is coming to a close. He's expected to issue a "flurry" of additional pardons before leaving the White House, according to a source close to the White House.  Trump has used his clemency powers less often than any other recent president, according to Justice Department data . He has issued 29 pardons and 16 commutations , according to the department, for a total of 45 acts of clemency -- the fewest combined for a president in over 100 years.  But those figures could change. Trump associates including Rudy Giuliani, who has been leading the President's long-shot legal battles to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and disenfranchise millions of voters in his role as Trump's personal attorney, are making appeals to him in the hopes of obtaining pardons before he leaves office, a source familiar with the matter told CNN on Tuesday.  And since the election, Trump has been discussing with advisers preemptively pardoning several people close to him, including his children, son-in-law and Giuliani, a separate source familiar confirmed to CNN. Here's who Trump has granted pardons and commutations to during his presidency
