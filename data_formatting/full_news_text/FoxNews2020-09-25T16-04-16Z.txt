A 17-year-old accused of shooting at a Department of Public Safety trooper in Phoenix last week is an "unlawfully present citizen of Mexico," and has been charged with attempted first-degree murder of a peace officer, officials said.  Early in the morning of Sept. 17, Luis German Espinoza Acuna allegedly jumped out of a silver Infiniti sedan and ambushed the detective with an "AK Pistol variant." The detective got out of his vehicle and returned fire as a second DPS officer engaged the shooter.  The driver of the Infiniti escaped, leaving Acuna behind. The two detectives were able to apprehend Acuna without anyone being hurt.
