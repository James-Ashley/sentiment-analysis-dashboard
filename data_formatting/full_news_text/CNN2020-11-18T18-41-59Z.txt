Washington (CNN) A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from turning back unaccompanied migrant children at the US-Mexico border under a public health order implemented in March, a major blow to the administration, which has relied on the order to swiftly expel migrants during the coronavirus pandemic.  Earlier this year, as coronavirus swept across the country, the Trump administration invoked a public health law that allowed for the removal of migrants, including children, apprehended at the border -- a move that raised concerns among officials involved in compiling data who believed it to be driven by political motivations.  Since March, the Trump administration has removed around 197,000 migrants under Title 42, as it's known, according US Customs and Border Protection data , including children.  US District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration doesn't have the authority to expel children under the law and argued the injunction is warranted given harm to the children.  The plaintiff in Wednesday's case is a 16-year-old boy from Guatemala who entered the US in August 2020 and was apprehended by CBP. After the motion was filed, the government exempted him from the public health order, the ruling states.
