The hostile NBC town hall that President Trump attended on Thursday had a moment of levity after one of the attendees paid the president a compliment.  Paulette Dale, who was described by moderator Savannah Guthrie as a "registered Republican" who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and was "leaning" towards voting for Joe Biden, had prepared to ask the president about his immigration stance, but not before she admired his smile.  "Good evening, Mr. President," Dale began. "I have to say- you have a great smile."  CRITICS PANS NBC TOWN HALL, SAVANNAH GUTHRIE FOR 'DEBATING' TRUMP, ABC FOR GIVING 'SOFTBALLS' TO BIDEN  "Thank you, thank you," Trump grinned with a chuckle, which sparked a round of applause from the other attendees.  "He does!" Dale doubled down. "You're so handsome when you smile."  Dale later told Fox News that she found Trump looking "younger and more attractive" with his smile, which she instinctively told the president directly.  "While not a supporter of his politically, I find it tragic that we are expected to be unkind to people whose values we do not share," Dale said. "The ability to say something positive to President Trump (and sincerely mean it) and simultaneously disagree with him should not be mutually exclusive."
