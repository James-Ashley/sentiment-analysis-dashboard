The words of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and President-elect Joe Biden on Saturday night carried a special meaning for immigrants and children of immigrants, who said the victory speeches filled them with pride, inspiration and hope.  Eric Mavakala, a 29-year-old master's student from Paris who studies cyber security at Marymount, was a part of a jubilant gathering in the streets of Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C. There, music played as some in the crowd pulled away to watch the speeches on their cell phones.  Mavakala said it has been harder for him to get into the country under the Trump administration, and he had been hassling his friends to vote because he cannot.  “He did it,” Mavakala said. “It’s beautiful and I wanted to show some love.”  In her speech, Harris — the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants — highlighted the work that Black women specifically have put into this nation's democracy. Black voters, particularly Black women, helped propel the Biden and Harris victory.  She also spoke of her late mother, who came to the United States at the age of 19, saying she might not have imagined this moment but that she "believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible."  On social media, immigrants and children of immigrants shared their emotional reactions as Harris and Biden celebrated their election.  "Watching my mother, an immigrant to this country, cry tears of joy as she watched those speeches makes me want to hug every single person who voted to make this happen," tweeted author and TV producer Elan Gale. "Thank you thank you thank you all."
