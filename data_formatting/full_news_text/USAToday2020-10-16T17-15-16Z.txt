ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Maryland's Republican Gov. Larry Hogan wrote-in former President Ronald Reagan on the ballot he mailed in last week rather than vote for either President Donald Trump or his Democratic challenger Joe Biden.  The news, which was first reported Friday by The Washington Post, was confirmed on Twitter later that day by Hogan's communications director Mike Ricci.  "I know it’s simply symbolic. It’s not going to change the outcome in my state. But I thought it was important to just cast a vote that showed the kind of person I’d like to see in office," Hogan told the Post.  Hogan, a fierce critic of the president, did not vote for Trump in 2016 either, writing in his father, Larry Hogan, Sr., instead of voting for Trump or Hillary Clinton that year. Hogan told the Post he considered Reagan "my hero in politics" along with his father, Larry Hogan Sr., a three-term Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives.

The Maryland governor has been especially vocal in his condemnation of Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic, at one point purchasing 500,000 COVID-19 test kits directly from South Korea because he felt the federal government had left the governors to fend for themselves.  Other sitting Republican governors who said they will not vote for Trump include Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and Vermont Gov. Phil Scott. Maryland's Republican Gov.
