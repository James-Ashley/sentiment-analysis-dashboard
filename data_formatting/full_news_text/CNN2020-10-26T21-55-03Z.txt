(CNN) Democrats are weighing their options when it comes to the filibuster, arguing that the tool that requires a supermajority of votes and usually bipartisan support to pass legislation cannot be used to block them at every turn if they win back the Senate majority and the White House.  Some Democrats are saying it is too soon to talk about the fate of the legislative tool with just a little over a week to go until Election Day.  While Democratic leaders have tried to downplay any threat to the filibuster in recent weeks, arguing that discussing tactics ahead of November 3 isn't what matters to voters, some rank-and-file members are entertaining the idea of eradicating the legislative tool if they find themselves back in control of government and Republicans stand in their way.  "Look, I like the filibuster. I think bringing people together to find common ground is really important," said Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana. "But I will also tell you I didn't come here to do nothing. So if Republicans are in the minority and they just stonewall stuff, and it doesn't look like we are going to get anything done, I will reconsider."  Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, also told CNN that he's long backed the filibuster, but wouldn't rule out getting rid of it if Republicans blocked a Democratic President's agenda at every turn.
