Recent polls of Florida show President Trump receiving strong support from Latino voters, which could help him keep the Sunshine State's 29 electoral votes in the Republican column, former deputy White House Chief of Staff told "The Daily Briefing" Thursday.  "NBC and Marist shows he's winning Hispanics by three points, he's doing well among the Cuban-Americans that are returning to their historic anti-Communist, pro-Republican roots but he's also getting support from a large number of Venezuelans and other South American immigrants in Florida," the former George W. Bush adviser told host Dana Perino.

"There is also a poll in Miami-Dade which shows him getting, I think, 37% of the vote from a Democratic pollster who is well-respected," Rove went on.

"The Obama-Biden administration naturalized relations with Cuba," Rove explained. "Trump reversed that. Now Biden is saying that he’s going to go back to that.
