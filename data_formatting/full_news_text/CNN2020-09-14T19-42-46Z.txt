(CNN) A split federal appeals court panel said the Trump administration can terminate humanitarian protections for 300,000 immigrants from Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti and El Salvador.  The decision means that thousands of immigrants who have lived in the United States could eventually be deported.  Temporary Protected Status -- a form of humanitarian relief -- applies to people in the United States who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict or natural disasters, and allows them to legally work in the US. The Trump administration has criticized TPS, arguing that repeated extensions of the status are contrary to its purpose and moved to terminate protections for certain countries.  In a 2-1 ruling Monday, a panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals found that, under the TPS statute, the Department of Homeland Security secretary "possesses full and unreviewable discretion as to whether to consider intervening events in making a TPS determination."  US Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Dan Hetlage said in a statement the agency is "reviewing the decision and will announce updates as they are available."
