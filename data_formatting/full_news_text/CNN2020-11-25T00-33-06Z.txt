Washington (CNN) President-elect Joe Biden said Tuesday that communication from the Trump administration to help with his transition has been "sincere" since the General Services Administration ascertained his election win on Monday.  "Immediately, we've gotten outreach from the national security shop to just across the board," Biden told NBC News' Lester Holt in his first interview as President-elect.  "And they're already working out my ability to get presidential daily briefs, we're already working out meeting with the Covid team in the White House and how to not only distribute but get from a vaccine being distributed to a person able to get vaccinated."  "So I think we're gonna not be so far behind the curve as we thought we might be in the past," he added.  Biden's comments come one day after the GSA informed him that the Trump administration is ready to begin the formal transition process. His transition team is now in talking to all federal agencies, a transition official told CNN. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases doctor, said Tuesday he has had preliminary conversations with members of Biden's team and looks forward to more substantive discussions in the future.
