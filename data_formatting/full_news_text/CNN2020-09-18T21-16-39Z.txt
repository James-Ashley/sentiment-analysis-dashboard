San Francisco (CNN Business) All eyes may be on TikTok this weekend as the Trump administration blocks it from app stores, but there's another big Chinese-owned app that will suffer a similar — if not worse — fate.  Tencent TCEHY WeChat, owned by China's, will also no longer be available on US app stores after Sunday night, according to Department of Commerce officials. That means, like TikTok, it cannot be downloaded, and while people who already have the app may continue to use it, they won't be able to receive future updates or security patches.  Additionally, companies that make up the backbone of the internet, such as web hosting services and server networks, will be prohibited from hosting or carrying WeChat internet traffic from Sunday onwards, the Department of Commerce said in a release . The order doesn't impact home and wireless internet providers, Commerce officials told CNN Business, so existing WeChat users can continue using the app but may face some outages as a result of the hosting restrictions.  "Given that WeChat is heavily reliant on content delivery services in the United States to optimize the app — to make sure content can be delivered with necessary speeds — by prohibiting those services, users will experience some dysfunction and latency to the point there will be an outage or a message will time out," said one of the officials. "We do expect it may be useable, but it may not be particularly functional after Sunday."  TikTok will not face those restrictions until November 12, the deadline set by President Trump's executive order last month calling for the short-form video app to completely divest its US business.
