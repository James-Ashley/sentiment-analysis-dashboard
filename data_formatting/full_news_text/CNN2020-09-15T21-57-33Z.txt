Washington (CNN) The US ambassador to Hungary announced Tuesday that he will step down from his post on November 1, two days before the US presidential election.  David Cornstein , a longtime friend of President Donald Trump, said in a statement that he had informed the US President and the Hungarian foreign minister of his decision "with a deep sense of pride, as well as some sadness."  "It has been an honor and a privilege to serve the country that I love in a country that I have come to cherish, but our bilateral relationship is more than just one person," Cornstein said. "Working with the entire team at U.S. Embassy Budapest, both Americans and Hungarians, I am proud of how much we have accomplished together in strengthening our countries' bonds as allies."  "While I will miss Hungary and all the wonderful friends and memories I have made here, my Embassy team, Hungary, and the Hungarian people will always remain in my heart," he said.  Cornstein's statement did not provide a reason for his departure.  Read More US ambassador to Hungary to step down
