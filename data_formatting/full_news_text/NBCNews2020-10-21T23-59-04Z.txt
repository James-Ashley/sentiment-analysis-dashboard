The remarks were in reference to a New York Times report on Trump’s previously undisclosed bank account in China. NBC News has not confirmed the report. Speaking at a Citizens Bank Park, where the Philadelphia Phillies play, Obama delivered a wide-ranging campaign speech in which he also attacked Trump over his pandemic response, his failure to secure additional stimulus for families suffering during the outbreak, his attempted dismantling of the Affordable Care Act, and the general daily chaos he said Americans have experienced during his presidency. "With Joe and Kamala at the helm, you’re not going to have to worry about the crazy things they say every day," Obama said, adding, "You’ll be able to go about your lives knowing the president isn’t tweeting about conspiracy theories." And he reprised his attack line from his speech during the virtual Democratic National Convention in August, saying that he "did hope for the sake of the country that [Trump] might show some interest in taking the job seriously." “But it hasn’t happened. He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself or his friends,” Obama said.

In the film, a copy of which was obtained by NBC News, Giuliani and a fictional young female reporter, who was part of Cohen's sting, can be seen going into a hotel bedroom for drinks — at the woman's invitation — after completing what the former mayor apparently believed to be a real interview about the coronavirus pandemic and Trump's response to the crisis. Giuliani responded in a pair of tweets on Wednesday. (1) The Borat video is a complete fabrication. I was tucking in my shirt after taking off the recording equipment.    At no time before, during, or after the interview was I ever inappropriate. If Sacha Baron Cohen implies otherwise he is a stone-cold liar. — Rudy W.

Mitt Romney, one of the president's most prominent Republican critics, told NBC News he did not vote for Trump in this year's election.

"The pandemic would have been hard for any president," Obama said during a socially distanced roundtable discussion in Philadelphia with Black community leaders. "But the degree of incompetence and misinformation, the number of people who might not have died, had we just done the basics," suggested that Trump did not rise to the occasion in responding to the outbreak, Obama added. He did not mention the president by name in his remarks. Obama also urged young Black people to vote in the upcoming election, explaining that doing so can help give them a voice and "make things better." Responding to a question about how he might talk to young Black people in Philadelphia about voting, he said that his message "is not that voting makes everything perfect, but that it makes things better." "Anyone who says things haven't gotten better in the history of this country ... is somebody who didn't live through ’50s or the ’40s or the ’30s," the former president said. "And the reason things changed is because people voted," he added. "And that is going to continue how we bring about changes," Obama said. Obama, sporting a black face mask, later told the audience that he was "confident that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris" would "deliver on some of their promises" because "they know how to build coalitions." The roundtable marked the first time in the 2020 election that Obama stumped in person for his former vice president. The event was the first of two campaign events of the day for Obama. Later, he will lead a drive-in rally for Biden in Philadelphia.
