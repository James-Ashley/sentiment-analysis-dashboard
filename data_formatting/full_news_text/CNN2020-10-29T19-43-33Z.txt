Washington (CNN) The Trump administration's top border official, Mark Morgan, said Thursday that Twitter locked his account and removed a tweet regarding the effectiveness of the border wall.  "The tweet basically read that walls absolutely are an important part of a multi-layer strategy that assist the men and women of CBP to apprehend criminals. That's what my tweet said. And Twitter took the tweet down," said Morgan, the senior official performing the duties of the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection.  Morgan was speaking Thursday morning alongside acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and other Department of Homeland Security officials near the US-Mexico border in Texas to promote nearly 400 miles of wall construction.  He said the tweet was "intended to emphasize that border security is national security" and was similar to hundreds of tweets he has posted in the past couple of years.  "With all due respect, Twitter, your locking my account doesn't pass the BS test," he added. "They may have locked my Twitter account, but they're not going to lock my voice."
