(CNN) The GOP is starting to look a lot like an autocratic party, a large study into political identity has found.  Experts from the V-Dem Institute at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden said the US Republican Party had become more illiberal and populist in recent decades and that its recent retreat from democratic norms has left it resembling authoritarian ruling parties like Hungary's Fidesz and Turkey's AKP  "What we see is that the disrespect of political opponents, the encouragement of violence and also the violation of minority rights ... they have all clearly increased with the Republican Party in recent years, since [President Donald Trump] came in the leadership but also before that," Anna Luehrmann, V-Dem's deputy director and one of the lead authors of the study, told CNN.  The US Democratic party has not shown a similar shift towards illiberalism, according to the study.  Researchers found that Democrats had become more populist and more anti-elitist since 2000, but less so than the Republicans. The move on the illiberalism scale pushed the GOP further away from its traditional European equivalents and towards more autocratic groupings.
