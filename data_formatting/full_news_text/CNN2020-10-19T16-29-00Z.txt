(CNN) First lady Melania Trump will join President Donald Trump at his Erie, Pennsylvania, rally on Tuesday evening, according to a White House official. It will be the first lady's first in-person appearance at a campaign event, outside of August's Republican National Convention speech at the White House, in more than a year, when she joined the President last June at the official reelection kick-off rally in Florida.  The first lady is not expected to give solo remarks at Tuesday's Pennsylvania event nor does she have any upcoming appearances or travel related to the campaign on her calendar for the foreseeable future, a source familiar with Trump's schedule told CNN. The election is 15 days away.  Travel restrictions due to coronavirus throughout the last several months, and her own bout with Covid-19, hindered Trump's work schedule, her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told CNN. However, the President, vice president and other members of the Trump family have hit the campaign trail.  Melania Trump has not historically been a visible presence on the campaign trail, eschewing appearances while other Trump surrogates crisscross the country. In the entire 2016 election cycle, Trump gave only a handful of solo speeches. Her longest in Pennsylvania, was just five days before the 2016 election, and came after a months' long hiatus from the campaign trail.  "I'm an immigrant, and let me tell you that nobody values the freedom and opportunity of America more than me," said Trump at the time, after an introduction by second lady Karen Pence, an active campaigner in both 2016 and 2020.
