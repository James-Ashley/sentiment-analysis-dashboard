(CNN) California Sen. Dianne Feinstein announced on Monday that she would step down from the top Democratic spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee next year, following sharp criticism from liberal activists over her handling of the hearings for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.  Feinstein, 87, said she would "increase" her "attention" on the wildfire and drought crisis in California and that three issues -- the coronavirus pandemic, climate change and "access to health care" -- are "critical national priorities that require even more concentration."  Her statement did not mention Barrett's confirmation to replace the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which further cemented the conservative majority on the Supreme Court.  While Democratic senators could not block Barrett's nomination in the Republican-led Senate on their own, liberal activists were apoplectic when Feinstein undermined Democrats' relentless attempt to portray the process as illegitimate when she praised Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham's leadership of it.  Democrats including Feinstein had blasted Senate Republicans for rushing to confirm the nominee in the month before Election Day, after blocking President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016 because it was an election year. But after four days of hearings in October, Feinstein told the South Carolina Republican that "this is one of the best set of hearings that I've participated in," and hugged him.
