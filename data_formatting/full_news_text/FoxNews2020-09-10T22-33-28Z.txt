A three-judge panel from a federal court in New York has blocked President Trump’s order to exclude counting illegal immigrants for the purpose of redrawing congressional districts.  The panel ruled that the move would violate the law and granted an injunction halting it.  They also blocked Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who runs the department that oversees the Census Bureau, from excluding illegal immigrants when turning over data to be used to calculate the number of House seats each state receives.

President Trump has tried and failed yet again to weaponize the census against immigrant communities," Dale Ho, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said in a statement.
