Washington (CNN) Top officials in the US Justice Department were the "driving force" behind President Donald Trump's controversial zero tolerance immigration policy that separated thousands of migrant children from their families, according to a draft of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation report reviewed by The New York Times.  In one May 2018 episode detailed in the draft report, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions told a group of prosecutors on a conference call, "We need to take away the children," according to participants' notes, the Times reported.  Days later, according to the paper, then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told prosecutors in a second call that migrant children should be separated regardless of their age, adding that lawyers should have prosecuted two cases that involved children who appeared not much older than infants.  Following that call, the departing US attorney in western Texas, John Bash, wrote to his staff that Rosenstein "instructed that, per the A.G.'s policy, we should NOT be categorically declining immigration prosecutions of adults in family units because of the age of a child," the Times reported.  The revelations detailed in Horowitz's 86-page draft report offer new insight into the involved role that top Justice Department officials played in implementing the Trump administration's zero tolerance immigration policy that was in place from May 2018 to late June 2018. The policy called for the criminal prosecution of adults crossing the border, resulting in thousands of children being separated from their parents and placed in government care.
